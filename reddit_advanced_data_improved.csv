1pqddi7,The fragility behind suicidal posts that most people miss,"Honestly, after reading so many posts from people struggling with self-harm or suicidal thoughts, a pattern becomes impossible to ignore. You can feel the helplessness in their words. Some are still fighting, some are just venting, and some sound like they’ve already given up. And while it doesn’t feel right to just scroll past, the truth is there’s nothing you can say that will magically make that emptiness disappear.

People who are set on unaliving themselves are often the ones who’ve already tried everything they could to survive. After going in circles for so long, unaliving starts to feel like peace to them. I’m not saying I support that, not at all. I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts myself for years, so I understand the mindset behind it, even if I don’t agree with the outcome.

That’s why words matter so much in these spaces. One poorly phrased comment can do real harm. It’s a fragile situation, and that’s often why people hesitate to reply at all. Not because they don’t care, but because they’re afraid of saying the wrong thing.

People in that mental state need professional help, no doubt about it. What strangers online can do is listen, hold space, and respond without judgment. Sometimes just being seen and understood matters more than advice. Being there is the bare minimum we can offer as strangers navigating something this serious.",85,20,2025-12-19 11:16:57,hisdelirium,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pqddi7/the_fragility_behind_suicidal_posts_that_most/,mentalhealth,0.98,Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm,-0.7028,0.0017857142857142904,-0.8603585958480835,-1,-0.6406621550668989,-1

1pqglrr,I think I actually experienced 10/10 pain last week.,"Honestly traumatized by the pain. I know people claim to be in 10/10 a lot but I actually reached the point where 1 the pain got so bad I tried to scream and could not make a sound. That was scary. 2 I was literally drifting in and out of consciousness due to pain.

At some point I tried to express to my nurse I think my pains at a 9 and she looked at me and said ""oh sweetie you're coming in and out of consciousness from pain, I already marked it as a 10.""

I thought I had a high pain tolerance but damn that was horrible. All over some rib muscle spasms from a bad hospital bed too. Luckily the on call doctor put in for multiple emergency doses of fentayl until my pain was under control and I was considered stable so the nurse was able to keep dosing me until we got it to stop. But damn. 10/10 pain is no joke guys. It's also definitely not posting on reddit or something you are experiencing for a long term basis. Like my doctor was worried about my vitals crashing my pain was so bad we couldn't get it under control. You also just can't exist in that state for very long.

The pain also screwed up my breathing dangerously because I literally couldn't inhale enough with where it was (around my ribs)

Side note, for those who have experienced a true 10/10 how did you recover mentally? Like I'm afraid to taper back down on my prn pain meds because what if the pain gets bad again? I'm not in the hospital to get emergency doses of fentayl anymore. \*To be clear I'm only taking what I'm prescribed I'm just talking the max of what I'm prescribed and usually I only take 1-2 prn tablets a day. Now I'm taking 8 (max I'm prescribed) \* Did you live in fear of going back to that pain again for a while?",5,7,2025-12-19 14:37:37,Key-Moose-3893,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pqglrr/i_think_i_actually_experienced_1010_pain_last_week/,mentalhealth,0.73,Need Support,-0.9984,-0.0811567285760834,-0.8000940084457397,0,-0.7157983499380864,-1

I cannot believe who I have become. I cannot change it, because of my thought process. My subconscious is fucked up. And the worst part is that I don't know what to do or where to go, what would I do to change all of that. 

  
I have so many blockages that blocks my thought processes. Ah, I become nobody and not worthy at all. A lot of demons are in my brain and I cannot be happy. I cannot even relate with anyone, I can only work my ass off, cause life doesn't have any meaning. 

  
You can say to me, create a meaning, BUT WHAT if I cannot create it? What if you fucking ruined your thought process and don't know what to even think? What if you don't have any worth any desire to have anything cause that's so deep that you cannot change. I only feel a little bit of bliss sometimes but that's impossible to sustain cause its like you are trying to control to be in that state all the time, its impossible.

Do I not have depression anymore or is she wrong, I tried to say to her “do I still have depression but it’s just gotten better?” And she kind of not really answered the question, so what do you think? I feel like she thinks I’m not depressed because I do do stuff, like I go to the gym and go to my tennis practice and do my piano lesson but most of the time I don’t even want to do it I just do it cause I feel like I’m on auto pilot. I sit in my room every night and I’m just sad, I don’t know how to get better, I feel like if I were skinnier I would be happier but idk.

1pqg3f5,just spitballing random thoughts,"Good mental health” isn’t about never feeling like garbage. It’s about:

• Recognizing “oh, this is the brain gremlins talking, not the truth” while you’re spiraling

• Letting yourself order takeout and rewatch the same show for 3 hours instead of forcing “productivity”

• Saying “I can’t” when you can’t—even if it feels “selfish”

• Not beating yourself up for having a “bad day” right after a “good streak”

We’re so obsessed with “being better” that we forget: the messy, unpolished, “I don’t have my sh\*t together” moments? They’re not failures. They’re just… being human.

1pqj8lm,How to be mentally strong despite being single at 30 and keep hopeful that you will have a fullfiling relationship one day?,"
As a single 29 year old the last time I have been in love was a decade ago. I want to experience the feeling again but I haven't had anyone to connect with. I know there are people out there who are my age and  married and share their life with someone while I am alone. Some people like being alone but I don't I am miserable and want to share my life with a woman whom I love but I haven't met her still and also women are not attracted to me despite me being fit, not ugly,educated and having a above average paying job. I know that women might not care about those things and deem them superficial but I have worked hard to achieve them and want to put them forward. 

  Despite not sounding manly when I say it I want to experience love and passion and longing for someone and of course my ego does not stay silent so I want someone to want me back and validate my attractiveness. 

  I know about the statistic that women are more attracted to men in relationships but I think this might be taken to more of an extreme than we think and for women to take it as upright suspicious that a man who has no visible reason to be single is which I think lowers my attractiveness more. It is also easy to say that you will find the one when you stop looking but it's like telling a thirsty person he will get water when he stops thinking about it. 
  
  I am writing this because I literally woke up at 5 last night from a dream where I observed my block of flats with two cars parked outside one was mine and the other was supposedly of my girlfriend. I woke up with the though I am single and I might forever be and I felt like my body is aching as a response I went to sleep for an hour shortly after but the emptiness was still there I don't want to wake up every night. 

  Also and this is important I have these neighbours that life in my hometown where I live. They are opposite the street and I see them when I look at the window so basically they are 2-3 years older than me,live in the block of flats the  woman's dad built and are both doctors. When I am back in my hometown for the holidays I have to see them every day and sometimes I wish I could for a second live their life to be a hotshot doctor, have a girlfriend who is also a doctor and not be sexless like I am for the rich parents I don't care much but it would be a benefit. Image going to bed with a fit female doctor every night by my side than hug a pillow like I do. Although I know people will say that this couple might be miserable as well I can't believe it as I am sure they look at people who are single than me and living in rent in another city and pity them and are thankful what they have again I don't mind paying the rent I mind that they are a couple while I am single single single.",1,1,2025-12-19 17:23:21,Pale-Revolution-5151,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pqj8lm/how_to_be_mentally_strong_despite_being_single_at/,mentalhealth,1.0,Venting,0.9933,0.0745595489781536,-0.7169411182403564,1,-0.04556864932454752,0
1pqfk9s,Whats wrong with me? (Calling psychologists or anyone who can identify),"Ok adress title; I dont say ""whats wrong with me"" as in ""oh im so emo im depressed ill never be ok"" no i mean it as litterally just ""why dont I work."" I'm not taking anything personally, I like who I am, I am proud of my mind or whatever it is I see in myself. But something in me is broken; not feels, is. The second I step into a room and people are in there I turn into an absolute freak of anxiety, cognitive disfunction (idk if that ones right just two words that seem to fit), and an overall mess: Emphasis on the mess. I tend to lean into this freak mess thing too. I always place, functionally and intuitively, myself at the bottom of social heierarchies. Im the weird kid, I know that and I live up to that. But Im weirder that i want to be. i want to be respectable I want to just be different but im genuinely just weird the second i percieve eyes in the room. My brain shuts down and my thoughts stop thinking. it is definitly an anxiety thing but why. Is it autism? is it BPD? is it social anxiety disorder? It cant be social anxiety disorder, i dont care what people think about me. Like i said earlier im the weird kid and i dont mind living up to that. But Im not myself when theres people around. New people or familiar people, though its different with familiar people. With my friends I am very dopamine searching (diagnosed inatentive adhd btw). My only stream of conciousness seems to be what gets me and everyone else the next laugh. But it feels safe. With new people its just blank, nothing. What to say what to do? Freeze. thats all I can do physically. That feels dangerous. 'I need to get out, but i cant get out. If i try to get out they will pick up on that.' -says my mind. With familiar people that I dont care for or dont have the share a laugh constantly relationship with I just dont interact with them and pray they dont interact with me. I dont avoid interacting with people because I fear making a fool of myself, I avoid interacting with people because I am not myself. I love writing, and Im really good at it too. I wrote my first play ever within 3 days, people spend months on theirs, recently and submitted it to thespys, a district wide theater competition, and got scores of 19/20, 19/20, and a 16/20 (that one anonymous judge, count your days). But for the life of me I cant find that same intuition and intelligence in person. i love texting because I can find that inutition and intelligence. Many people I know have noted how different I am over text. i have dropped wisdom that nobody would ever expect from me when only knowing me in person. Its a struggle for sure. But what makes it so much harder than just a bit of social anxiety is that I think this is why so many people find me repulsive. From across the room people pick up on an anxious composure and social akwardness and their brain will immediately flag it as a threat. How am i supposed to show them otherwise if i cant form more than 2 single syllable words without stuttering and being swallowed by the brick with a gravitational pull in my stomach. All I do is reinforce their fears about me. Any psycologists out there have any clue what this is? I know what it is emotionally, im very self aware and can read peoples responses and though process to it, but if i cant identify like a name or something to it I cant look into it and understand why or what I can do to fix it. So I ask, whats wrong with me?

I’m actively trying to fix things and find therapy but the process itself has been exhausting - calls not getting picked up, not knowing where to turn, and feeling like I’m constantly starting from zero.

Right now, what’s hardest is the feeling of being alone while I’m “figuring things out.” I’m already trying. I just need a space to talk, to feel heard, and maybe connect with people who understand what this feels like. Just a friend or someone whom i can share things with while i try to better myself. i feel like everything is shutting down and no one is around me.

1pq8sg2,struggle with inappropriate laughter in situations where I must not laugh. Looking for advice.,"I'm a Japanese male in my 20s, and I’m struggling with something often described (in Japanese) as fear of inappropriate laughter.

It doesn’t happen every day, but in situations where I absolutely should not laugh, I sometimes feel an urge to laugh, or I end up laughing, which causes a lot of distress.

This is not stage fright or social anxiety.
I’m completely fine with public speaking, presentations, and even performing music and singing in front of people. I’m not shy, and I’m generally comfortable with new people.

The situations where this tends to happen are very specific, such as:

silent scenes in movie theaters

ordering food at a restaurant

being alone in an elevator with a stranger


Basically, situations where I feel like I should “erase my presence,” stay neutral, or blend into the background.

It also gets worse the more I think, “I must not laugh.”
Because of this, situations like funerals are especially worrying to me.

Has anyone experienced something similar?
If so, I’d really appreciate hearing about coping strategies, explanations, or anything that helped you improve.

Thank you for reading.

1pq9a85,I quit my job a month ago to focus on my mental and physical health.,"hi guys, i’m 25F and i’m in the Camp/Teaching industry. 

Earlier this year, i went through a traumatising event that changed my life. The building that my previous company owned caught on fire and i was part of the internal team that helped get the kids out of the burning building. it was so hard for me as i saw a child die in front of my eyes. Barely 6 months before the incident, my dad passed away very suddenly. I didn’t have time to recover before the next trauma hit me. 

my mental health is in the worst state it has been in. my physical health as well. i think that quitting my job now is the right thing to do because i want to focus on myself and grieving properly. things feel so heavy on me now and im so scared i’ve given up a good career. 

i’ve been on autopilot mostly every day. and now my anxiety is at an all time high because it’s the time of the month and my hormones are haywire. 

it’s my last day of work today. i’ll miss the kids, most definitely. but im excited for the future, and my healing journey. i’d like some of your healing processes if you can share them with me :)

1pqh79u,Why did my body panic when my mind felt calm?,"Yesterday around 3 am, I took my 3yr old to the ER because she was showing signs of retracted breathing.

I was calm and focused the entire time- until the intake nurse asked, “What brings you in?” The moment she finished the question, I suddenly started crying uncontrollably for about two minutes. It wasn’t quite tearing up; it was full on sobbing, like something truly awful had happened.

From the nurse’s reaction, I could tell she assumed there was a much more serious or traumatic reason for our visit based on how I was crying. That made me even more embarrassed. I apologized and awkwardly blamed it on my period being about to start, even though I honestly didn’t know why I reacted that way.

What confuses me is that my daughter wasn’t in immediate danger, and I didn’t feel panicked before that moment. I still can’t understand why my body reacted so strongly, and it’s been bothering me ever since.

1pqh6j9,"Never been to therapist, but I guess that's a good start here","I'm 30M from Ukraine.  Before the war I've lived abroad and had a pretty decent job in Marketing, made really good money for the EU country I've used to live at, but visited my friends in Ukraine at not the best time. Last 3.5 years I work for the military. And I'll be honest, it was never a job I've dreamed off. I still have to work remotely (military complex doesn't pay well) and do some projects for US and EU clients, so I can support myself and my gf, but everyday it's getting harder and harder. Everyday I wake up at 5AM and my work is done by 11 - 12PM. First 3 years I had this internal feeling that I work to support my country and my family in this historical time, but for the last half a year it's getting harder and harder to convince myself that I can do that any longer. Every single day now, after the phone alarm goes off I have this stupid feeling that ""it would be better if a rocket or a drone just hit directly in my window and I'll never have to wake up again"". It's not suicidal thoughts, I don't wanna die, but living in this pace is getting quite hard . And the last drop was when my gf told me last week that she can't have kids. We wanted to have a family together, she is the only colourful and happy and always smiling creature I see in my grey life now, I did and I do everything to support her...but last week was just nerve wracking - I come home and she is crying every night. I try to comfort her, I say that we will figure something out, that we will find some clinics or a doctor, we will find the solution but she just starts crying harder and pushes me away. And I'll be honest, I have no idea what to do next, how to help her, how to help myself... I don't know why I'm writing it here...maybe I just want to hear some advices or something...unfortunately, I don't have many friends left to speak to and pour out my soul (some moved out, some died at war).

1pqgx1i,Christmas depression?,"Is this Christmas depression or holiday depression? Or a sign I need to up my meds? During the summer I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Got put on medication (which was a rough first few months) but then I finally started to feel more like myself….happier. until the holidays….in the beginning I was so excited for Halloween and I had all intentions of decorating outside and inside better than last year but my house became a wreck which stressed me out to no end but I also felt so drowned in it that I couldn’t even bring myself to tackle it. And I let my expectation of my fiancé helping out get the better of me because up to Halloween the house stayed a mess and I never finished decorating like I wanted to. Then I tried to enjoy Thanksgiving but I felt so pressured with Christmas when all the stores started pushing out Christmas November 1st that I felt I couldn’t even truly enjoy that and then I stressed about having to get Christmas stuff early because I knew by the time December came around majority of it would be gone….and that’s exactly what happened…but last year my fiancé and I had just moved into a new house and I did everything on time and was able to actually enjoy it….this year is the opposite…I’ve struggled with decorating and last week was when I really started to feel bad….like I’ve basically lost my Christmas spirit, if that makes sense. we hadn’t even gotten the tree up and my fiancé would keep telling me we’d get to it because I needed him to get it out the attic…and I know he works hard and is tired when he gets home but even on the weekends it never happened…and so I had a mental breakdown because I just felt like at this point it didn’t even matter anymore because Christmas was only two weeks away and to me I just wouldn’t have time to enjoy anything…then he finally got the tree down last weekend and said we’d work on it before this upcoming weekend…well it sat all week up until today when I finally had a little bit of excitement and decided to start stringing the lights on our tree (we like the incandescent lights so we have to string those in) but it took me most of the day..2pm-10pm….which it still never got finished because I had to keep running to the store to get more lights because somehow i kept running out…then i messed up because i didn’t realize i had more then 5 strands of lights hooked uo and what happened?? Blew out ALL the lights fuses….even the main tree plug…which means I’d have to change out all the fuses and restring the lights to fix not overdoing it…i judt felt so disappointed and so deafened because i tried so hard to enjoy it and the minute i felt like i was…boom it was all gone again…and im back to there being no point to even get to enjoy any of it and i told my fiance that im do done to the point where i want to take what ive started to do down and not even deal with Christmas this year.

1pqgezt,Read if u want to,"For the past few years everything in life went downhill. People say you improve with age and time heals everything, but so far it showed no progression and instead regression. I’m an addict (not specifying) who cant control myself to do anything. I constantly think about it day and night and its ruining my life.

Everything good from my life came out negativity. Whenever I tried to be positive everything seemed to go terribly wrong, and vice versa. It almost seems like life just wants me to lead a negative life to achieve success. Whenever I feel happy there is a negative outcome, whenever I feel sad it will all turn out just right.

And this incident didn’t even happen because of me! This addiction wasn’t because of me, but my parents. Or that’s what I tell myself, at least. They scolded me and hit me to shape me up into the “perfect “ child they had envisioned when I was already succeeding in life. I was respectful to them, studied hard and top of my class, I did everything a responsible child was supposed to do, why me?

Now I followed their ways that led me to this addiction, a worse life. I can’t stop… It’s ruining my life. They regretted their ways but they say i should stop blaming them, and I suppose they’re right, but I just can’t stop. This incident was shameful to my parents so they agreed not to disclose this matter to anyone. They did send me to therapy a couple of times but the therapist just gave me medication which only gave me a headache and nausea so I stopped taking them.

Sometimes I wish someone else would notice. I wish my friends would ask me if im ok, but then again I don’t have real friends anyway… I see people who cry in my class or thise who appear gloomy and everyonr swarms up to them and comforts them and asks them whether they want to talk about it. No one ever notices that I cry everyday when no one isn’t looking, how do they not noticed I zoom out or the anxiety attacks I have using the excuse of going to the bathroom? Maybe I’m seeking attention, is it weird to feel this way?

There was a low point my parents called me a freak instead of my name for the whole month due to my addiction. I never celebrate christmas or new years or any celebration with them anymore. Not even my birthday. They say I ruined the family because of my addiction, they say i should think more about them and less about me. They say i broke the family. Sometimes they threaten to divorce because of me, I don’t know if it’s a scaring tactic or what.

The worst part is I believe them. I think I’m a monster and they do too. They used to hit me but they gave up now. I hate when I see posts that say “at least they stopped hitting you, that’s so much better!” But i feel like this means they just stopped caring and gave up. I feel like they’re treating this addiction as the norm now, it’s like it’s not their fault and not their problem anymore.

Sometimes I imagine myself …ing of a building or …ing myself in the bathroom stall. Idk, probably wild imagination. I can’t bring myself to do it yk. I feel like a coward. I’m too afraid to live and too afraid to die. Ironic? I feel an odd satisfaction of picturing my death, but I can’t bring myself to make it happen. Sometimes I wish this addiction would stop my heart and I’d die instantly so I don’t have to keep doing this.",1,1,2025-12-19 14:25:25,Ok-Flatworm-4285,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pqgezt/read_if_u_want_to/,mentalhealth,1.0,Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm,-0.996,0.004841269841269855,-0.8981550931930542,1,-0.7469092926282732,-1

1pqg79z,"I’m usually the one who walks away first, even when people treat me well. Why?","I’ve noticed a pattern in my life and I’m trying to understand it.

Since childhood, I’ve often been the one who ends relationships or stops communicating, even when nothing “bad” is happening and the other person treats me well.

When I changed schools as a kid, I completely stopped talking to my close friend. In 2021, I ended a long online friendship. In 2022, I left a relationship with a guy I dated for a year. Recently, I stopped talking to a university friend I’d been close with since 2022.

The strange part is that I’m not incapable of long-term connection. I’ve had one close friend for almost 9 years, and I value that friendship deeply. I’ve never felt the need to run from it.

i brought up my mental health in a conversation with my mom today. and reminiscing upon all that's happened in the past few months, she declared ""this is it. this is the END. you're a psycho""

i dont think you can possibly make up phrases any more excruciating for me than what she comes up with to express her desperation. I know she's also hurt, but i do feel her cruelty. can i even trust what i feel anymore? is it just another delusion of my ill brain or is my heart aching too?

now it's a catastrophe. she told me that every person around is sick like me, but they contain themselves and stay healthy; that I've been given a chance to be a good succesfull person instead being an asylum vegetable foaming at the mouth, and i wasted it by being a spoiled lazy brat. professionalbhelp should feel liberating, but it's like she threatenes me with it. after giving me so many years of love and support she takes all that away the moment she is sure my mental sickness IS real and existing? im not even talking about my father, whom i inherited the ""crazy"" from. he thinks i am to blame because i didn't take the vitamins he told me to take and that made me sick, not the fact that his whole lineage has the same intricate condition, in an even more intense form with them partaking in dangerous cults.

my heart is pounding and tears are choking me, i feel all alone in this world, alone against the woman who used to be my world and is now my... what is she even? she is the one who gave me this life, but she doesn't see it, she sees me as a stillborn, my heart never beat, to her. she only remembers having given birth to this perfect little girl, what a cliché...
she would sometimes daydream and cry about how ""she was so lovable"" and i would say ""mom im still here!""

""yes but...""

i wonder how peaceful it would feel without their opinions ringing in my mind. how much of that anxious noise is coming from mom and not from the disorder of mine?

here in russia, so i am told, if they prove that what i am experiencing is the suspected schizotypal disorder and not an anxiety disorder/depression/ocd, then im gonna be taken away to a state clinic, shoved with medicine until im just a pile of flesh, which is what my mother doesn't want to have to interact with, for i ""will become agressive and hallucinating after a few rounds of psychiatric drugs"". 
so is it punishment at the clinic? or do they heal, i mean, help?

 i guess soon i will find out.

my mom has been pushing me all morning to ""get an appointment this instant"", she says she wants me to be taken away asap and never returned, but i know if they accidentally see my fresh self-injuries it's gonna be a more brutal treatment, from the trustworthy words of someone. if this life was a level of a video game, i would've started it over, i dont want to continue this level, I'm already losing.

1pqg10n,"Mom acting unstable, any recommendations?","26M
My mom haas always been extremely argumentative and pretty much loves to start verbal fights, with practically anyone for anything

A minor example be,
A delivery person called her the aunty (in our language it practically means someone older), this triggered her somehow, and she practically waited for days to call him something similar to uncle.

She has bursts of extreme arguments and it's causing both dad's and I to become irritated, and starting to affect his health.

She will not visit any doctor, she makes up reasons that we have bribed the doc or will take her someplace else.

I am at my wits end with this and this has been going on for my entire life.

We are thinking of putting her in a facility for a while to deal with this.
It sounds like a shit decision, but I don't really know what to do.

I consider my existence demonic and that I can only hurt people, do bad and immoral things towards anyone. I do anything  to convince myself that and I want to get rid of my body.

I have fears of being violated or raped, and those fears resurfaced recently when I saw some guy telling about how life starts at conception . I don't  want to live. I know how easily things can be forced to me since I'm  a weak person. The thought of doing something immoral or bad or even killing another life if I'd need to stop forced pregnancy terrifes me. I don't  want to bring pain to anybody  so badly I would rather rip my body apart.

1pqfuu2,Nearly everyone in my life is suicidal,"Full disclosure, I did smoke weed to hopefully relax this evening because the last few days in particular have been rough. So I am stoned while writing this so my apologies if it's a little bit unorganized.

Also, I myself am not suicidal. Depressed, sure. But not suicidal. So nobody has to worry about me 👍 okay onto the post:

I'm 20 years old, and so many people around me are suicidal. Both of my parents and my brother had attempted it before I was even 15. My best friend is better now, but she used to be extremely suicidal. My best friend's sister whome I've grown close to as well has suicidal tendencies. My other very good friend is suicidal. My mother is in active crisis basically every day and has been for years. My brother just got out of the psych ward, even though he definitely needed more time there.

I feel like everyone around me is crashing and I know that all of them feeling that way is worse than what I feel having to deal with all of it, but it's still hard, y'know? I feel like at the drop of a hat I could lose most of the important people in my life. Last night I had to have the millionth talk with my mother where she tells me that she's not doing well. It went on for hours until I was barely even conscious anymore. But I couldn't go to sleep, because my brother was waiting on the phone for me to hear about the events of the psych ward. And then today my friend got more vulnerable than he usually does and it freaked me out. It's terrifying. I'm scared that I could lose any of them at any moment.

And despite having experience with suicidal people my entire life, I've somehow never figured out what to say to any of them? I'm bad at those conversations, even though I have to have them nearly every day. I'm not good at being vulnerable and I suck at comforting people.

I don't know if I'm venting or asking a question or what. I'm just so tired, frustrated, scared, and anxious. And I feel guilty, because sometimes when my mother breaks down for the third time in a day for the ninth day in a row, I feel irritated more than anything. I wish everybody could be doing better, and I wish I could solve everybody's problems, and as terrible as it sounds, I wish I could have a break. I wish I didn't have to hear about it every single day of my life. I would rather take the burden of everyone's suffering and have them in my life than ignore them and lose them, but even so, I'm exhausted by being constantly on edge and having to constantly de-escalate situations and reassure people.

Please.,how do i know if i'm a romantic if i'm a relationship with someone and initlaly felt so much excitement and love and now feel numb but still want to be with them so much and am basically addicted to them but have been disassociating all my life. I feel this odd discomfort at her telling her things about me... As if I can't really comprehend her as a real person in my mind and as a result it's hard for me to feel genuine care and empathy most of the time... But sometimes I feel it really really strongly. If love is a choice then I'd choose her even if I'm completely attached to her and clinging to her because I need her.... I want to be with her even when I'm not. Everything just kinda sucks and I struggle interacting with her often unless it's venting... But I love her voice and her patterns and her beautiful face and I find myself missing her so much but I do also neglect everything else in my life but I also feel so safe with her.... But aaaaah I'm so confused. I just really want this to be real and I'd rather just end it before finding out I can't be with her because it's not actually real. I've been disassociating and derealizing almost all my life and I feel that way here too.. Except when I feel extreme jealousy towards her hanging out with someone else or liking someone else or her not being there when I need her and I often feel physically ill as if I'm addicted to her and I acknowledge I am and I want to be healthier about this. I really want to be with her but God I'm so confused. My head is in shambles. I just don't want to lose feelings for her and move on to someone else like I did with almost everyone before... I want to genuinely love her... So I'm clinging to her. It's just so unfair... I don't want to lose her. I hate this and I'm so scared I'm just using her.... and AAAAAAAAAAA.... I want to be with her... The thought of touching her beautiful face of her smile... Her laugh makes me feel safe and happy. I'm just so fucked up... I know this can't go on this way....

does anyone else feel like they're willing to kill themself at any moment? for example whenever you're standing at a high building edge you feel a strong urge to just jump and it's no big deal in your mind? if that makes sense

1pqb6f7,Negative thoughts never end,"I'm so critical all the time. My brain is constantly reminding me of every failure. Doesn't matter how minor or major the situation was, I'm constantly fighting myself. It literally never ends. I feel like my loved ones think that because I don't talk about it all the time then I must have some relief but I'm just sparing them. I get so annoyed with myself complaining so I know they do too. Nobody wants to be around the person you have to constantly ""cheer up"". I get tired of feeling the pity. So I keep it to myself, but the thoughts never seem to quit. Everytime I try to show myself some compassion or grace, my negativity shoots it down. My thoughts are constantly telling myself that I should've known better, telling me that I'm too self aware to mess up. I know it's illogical because no one is perfect, but it doesn't matter. I can't fight these thoughts with logic. 

I just got back into therapy and it's great but I can only afford an hour every two weeks so there's only so much we can discuss. So everyday I'm still just constantly anxious and overwhelmed by everything around me. IDK I'm terrified that all of this overload is going to cause me to have a depression episode like I did a few years ago and that was not pretty. 

I don't live the sorta life where I can just take a break. My boyfriend and I have 3 kids between the two of us and we just started blending our family recently and that's a whole other set of challenges.

Can someone be honest and tell me that I might be worrying about the wrong things. My belief is that if someone wants to reach me they can just text me. A huge part of me wants to be off Instagram especially but as a gen z'er the reaction is like- :0 I don't know, most of my ""followers"" are just classmates who monitor my every move as they do with eachother, and just people from the past that I don't really care to see.

1pqevf0,The Effects of Armchair Psychology,"You may be wondering what this post is about. Well in simple terms this post is basically the effects of those people who act like theripasts or the people who try to self-diagnose.

The most common forms of armchair psychology online are those mental health Discord servers who provide ""help"" to the members in them. This can also be seen as those depression tests, or using Web MD to doagnose. All though those resources can be helpful in many aspects they are most often used to find answers to their problems on their own without reflecting anything on a mental health professional.

I have noticed that alot of people online have had mental health issues, I can't confirm if they are being truthful or not. However based on the posts themselves and the way they are portraying it, it seems like they took the online sketchy depression test and just said ""Welp.. That's what's wrong with me. Time to post it on Tiktok for some support."" I want you to realize that there are so many factors to a mental illness such as MDD Major Depressive Disorder which affects over 300 million people world wide. Factors that are at play for mental illnesses are things like genetics, past mental health issues, drug use, ect.

When you do self-diagnose or go to those servers and subreddits tobget help there can be some pretty not good affects. Here's what I found by Better Help: [https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/psychologists/what-is-armchair-psychology-and-why-should-i-avoid-it/](https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/psychologists/what-is-armchair-psychology-and-why-should-i-avoid-it/)

Decreased self-esteem and self-confidence, Increased Stigma, Distressing Emotions, Not Seeking Professional Help, ect.

Over all not a very good thing. I'm curious, what are your experiences with these armchair psychologists?

1pqeldl,How to Stop Comparing Yourself,"I was scrolling and a video popped up saying something along the lines of :
“The types of girls you see when you’re finally starting to look pretty.” You can imagine. Small nose, sharp face, big eyes, big lips, straight hair.

But I have a wide jaw, a wider nose, big eyes, thinner lips and curly, messy hair. 

and it pretty much relapsed my self hatred. it’s been bad. i hate looking in the mirror. I cry. I hate going out in public and I hate being with my boyfriend since I feel like an embarrassment. 

If I had to be honest i’m so so tired but it’s like my brain hates me. I hate being filled with jealousy and yearning.

these girls are the ideal people I dream to look like. I have a boyfriend says I am the prettiest girl, and he has always stood on that, but I know there’s a hierarchy of looks. I know they’re prettier than me. What really upsets me when he thinks i’m a 10/10, and then I tell him that doesn’t make sense since i’d be on par with megan fox or other beautiful girls and he says yes. Which doesn’t make any sense. 

They are more ideal and I want to be more ideal How do I not break down ? I’ve tried every self improvement there is.But I hate my face and all I want to do is look exactly how i want to look. I’ve tried therapy and nothing has been helping. I want it to stop but it’s like i subconsciously do it.

Like my life doesnt feel put together, not much experience, and i feel to have glowed down. Maybe the unconfidence is messing with my head, maybe I'm putting her on a pedestal; maybe even the unconfidence is what causes me to not have everything good and straight I jjst dont know really. 

And thinking this way makes me sound like a little bitch which is lowk making me more unconfident like wth.

1pqe2z4,Will I ever get better?,"I'm a student (actually graduated last year with not so good marks) and I'm preparing for an exam now which can actually change my life if I crack it. The exam will be on March, which is now impossible for me to appear for the exam this time. So, I will maybe prepare for another year and then appear on the next one. But -

Now matter what I do I can't bring myself to study. I'm on my bed all day doom scrolling. I watch p- even if I feel like not watching. I tried quitting hundreds of times, read books on quitting but I never could.

This year my father died, my grandma died and then my girlfriend broke up. And I think it's been some months now that I haven't been able to do anything whatsoever. I nowadays sleep too early on some days like 7 pm and will sometimes wake up too early like 4am and then won't be able to sleep. And just doom scroll.

I have tried changing myself many times in the past: Like doing meditation regularly, reading books, stop using phone, using it on greyscale and literally every piece of advice that you're gonna give but nothing lasts more than some days.

Now I feel like I will never be able to get out of this rut. I don't even know what's causing me all these. While my friends who were really average students are now doing better than me in every way and I'm here dying like this.

I was a really bright kid in the start. I was the topper in school. Our principal would take my name in front of everyone during the parent teacher meetings as an example to the other kids. My neighbors, relatives, and everyone would used to say that I would grow up as a successful person and now I'm here fked up. I need help really bad. But I also think I'm just acting like I'm depressed to stay lazy.

p.s: I have vitamin D deficiency. It was 9 ng/ml last year and my doc gave me 8 tablets (60k IU) for 2 months. After that the levels came up to 27 ng/ml. I checked it last month.

1pqe0aw,Im tired of being isolated,"Im so tired of being isolated.

Everything i do revolves around my parents and their routines. If i wanna go somewhere i cant walk, i have to wait on them. If i wanna hang out with my friends they have to be there, i cant spend time with them alone. If i wanna spend my money i need their approval, even for something simple like a game.

All i get to do is go to school, go to 5 different stores with my mom every single day, go home, shower, eat, and sleep. I barely have any time for my hobbies or to study. And I always end up going to bed late because my mom spends so much time at the stores everyday my routine gets pushed back.

And ive been so depressed for the past 5 years. After covid i had to be in online school for 5 years. No friends, no socializing. And i can never get help for my mental health either. They refuse to get me checked for adhd or autism, which really sucks because im 99% sure i struggle with adhd and its making my life even worse becauss i struggle to focus during tests and school general.

And then i hate being told that im not struggling mentally because i never talk to my family about my mental health.

1pqdr11,The year has absolutely destroyed me and I'm hanging on by a thread.,"It started on New year's Day. 

My dad's 60th birthday. My grandmother had fallen and fractured her hip, and stayed in hospital for a month. She never came home. 

She deteriorated rapidly and was on palliative care. And we slept by her bed on the floor for 8 days, none of us wanting her to be alone when she passed. She finally passed 2 days after my birthday, in the first week of February. 

The grief was horrendous. She was the hub of our family, her home, where we would gather, she was the string that kept us all together. Her home would now be gone, closing that chapter of my grandparents house being our second home for all our lives. 

As months went on, we tried to get by as we could. In the springtime, I was dealing with such severe bullying in my job, that I had two nervous breakdowns that lasted a month each, where I considered ending it all. It absolutely destroyed all of my confidence and self worth, but I was resilient and kept going. 

Just as I was pulling myself out of that dark pit at the beginning of summer, I had a severe accident at the same job, where I had a complex fracture in my leg. Breaking it in two places, dislocating my ankle, and ripping out all of the ligaments in my ankle joint. I spent 3 days in hospital. On the same ward my grandmother died on, causing all the grief to come flooding back. I had surgery to put my leg back together, and now have a huge scar through one of my fave tattoo's, as well as metal plates and screws all under my skin. 

I spent 8 weeks in a cast, not allowed to bear weight on my leg at all, I was in a wheelchair at this time, and couldn't do anything for myself. 
A further 4 weeks in a walking boot, where I had the extremely painful experience of learning how to walk again. 

During this recovery and not related, I lost 3 very close friendships that had a significant impact on my life. And honestly, I'm still not over it. My usual healing mentally would have been going out to walk, which I was unable to now do. I healed myself through my grandmothers grief by doing a 100 mile charity walk. Yet now I was wheelchair bound and trapped in my own house. 

I'm now in intensive physio, and my leg has zero strength. I have to come downstairs one step at a time, I still walk using a cane, and I still haven't been able to go back to work, due to the nature of the job. 

Work was supposed to be finding me a desk role that would allow me to go back to work, instead they've informed me there's nothing they can slot me into, despite there being a receptionist position available and I have to go back to my role, or basically don't go back. 

I've been begging to go back to work, as I'm now on half of my wage, right before Christmas, and after bills, will have £100 to last me until the end of January. I'm now in touch with solicitors due to the accident being caused by my job and through no fault of my own.

I mourn the loss of what I used to be able to do. I was active, I did pole dancing, aerial silks and hoop, yoga, axe and knife throwing, and I'd walk through the forests near my house all the time. Part of me thinks I must have done something really bad to deserve this, and I constantly wonder if I'll go back to normal after this year and this life changing accident, or if this is my new norm. Worrying about money whilst begging work to find me something to do, or finding a new job, or if I'll ever get strength back in my leg.

1pqdlfk,Looking for advice about some strange symptoms. Nausea spell leading to flashing images? Anyone else have experience with this?,"I’m looking for some advice/wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this before. I apologize in advance as I’m sure this’ll be long and the formatting will be bad, but I’m trying to give as much info as possible.

So I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD for years. I’m talking like probably 8 or 9 years and I’ve been on medication the whole time. I’ve been stable on the same meds now for about 5 years with minor changes here or there to address increased anxiety. Typically, I’m very stable, only dealing with the occasional depressive episode or panic attack. Things I can manage through therapy or emergency meds.

But this last week, things have gotten really different, and I’m a bit worried. For context, I’m a senior in undergrad and came home for Christmas break last Friday and have been home for about a week. I’d been really looking forward to coming home as finals this semester were honestly really stressful and hard on me. But ever since I’ve gotten home, it’s like my mood has completely changed. I’m having these sudden and intense mood swings almost out of nowhere. I become frustrated and angry about things that shouldn’t bother me and then once I have an outburst I begin to cry, even sob and I feel horrible about myself (lot of negative self talk). My relationship with my family is stellar and they’ve been doing an incredible job of comforting and helping me. So I don’t think this is in relation to being around them.

But these mood swings are strange to me. I can’t remember another time in my life where I have felt so out of control of my emotions. They’ve sort of gotten better as the week has gone on. but something happened tonight that caught me off guard and seemed neurological in nature and I wasn’t sure where else to post this.

Late this evening, I began to feel very nauseous and I got nervous. I am a huge emetophobe and nausea freaks me out. I have meds I use to manage my nausea and typically after taking those and visiting the facilities, I’m all good. But tonight the nausea was much more intense and I found it hard to breathe. Figuring I was entering a panic attack, I took some emergency meds and nausea medicine and tried to lay down and breathe. But when I closed my eyes I felt disoriented and confused. And then I began to see flashes of images? Idk how to describe it. It wasn’t like a scene or a hallucination of something in the room with me. They were images that would flash in my mind I guess. I can’t remember them all, there were shapes and human like figures, I know this sounds absolutely absurd. But the one that stood out was a woman’s face, there was a dark liquid or something running down the middle of her face between her eyes and it genuinely scared me so bad I opened my eyes for a second but was still disoriented. There were other more abstract pictures and eventually I think I feel asleep? I’m not sure but I woke up to my mom telling me I should go to bed and the nausea had mostly passed.

All that to say, I get nauseous a lot. I have a lot of GI issues and am used to having to manage nausea. But this was different and not like my typical nausea spells. I guess I’m just looking for advice or wondering if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this? I haven’t made any huge changes to diet, routine, sleep, etc. and I have been taking all my meds as prescribed.",1,0,2025-12-19 11:29:29,Willing-Sherbet-2281,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pqdlfk/looking_for_advice_about_some_strange_symptoms/,mentalhealth,1.0,Question,-0.9929,0.039424951267056536,0.0,1,-0.28998500974658864,-1
1pqdjkv,I feel like I’m fighting every day,"For context, I am a middle school teacher, a grad student, in a relationship, and have a second job on the weekends.

You don’t notice it at first  but you start comparing timelines, progress, and even self-worth. What was meant to be “sharing” turns into pressure.

 “When learning turns into performance, joy disappears.”

So I’m stepping back from trying to grow and just using platforms as a learning log again. Building, failing, learning without the noise.

1pq3mz9,I hope this message finds you well. All Love to those who fight each day.,"To those who seek to end their lives. I am sorry for what happened to you. I am not saying this out of pity, but rather that I empathise with you. I was there once where you are now. I can genuinely say that it's a dark place with no lights, sound, or touch that feels like it engulfs every good moment. A type of alone that has no words to spare. 

If I may ask for just a moment to read this further. When something feels heavy, it requires a machine that can match the load of the weight otherwise, it would crumble. The weight of emotion is a lot, and no machine can carry it for us, but that is why we have words. The load we carry on the unseen backpack is not necessary to carry. If the words of others have broken you down, it is because they could not see the beautiful heart you carry. If they targeted your figure, they do not understand that the clay mould was so beautiful and precise that the potter's hands could not contain it. 

If they targeted your pride, they knew it was something they could never match at any time in their lifetime. If they robbed you of possessions, it's because they knew you were the only one with the courage to obtain them.

The world likes to ostracise the brilliant people who think ahead. They judge people without considering the real value they possess. 

If you decide to stay, please unpack that backpack piece by piece and bury it, never to return to it. I wish you the best in these times. Remember to rest, restore and grow better than those who stole or distorted your mind.

1pq8ga7,I want to stop being dependent on my friends for my happiness,"All my life, I’ve been a pretty sensitive person. I feel my feelings very deeply and get attached to ppl easily as well. I feel like a lot of my happiness stems from compliments, validation, support, love, and attention from my friends. Sometimes when I make a new friend, all of my attention is on them. I think of them a lot, like too much. I’m happiest when texting or being around them. I feel so connected and attached to some of my friends that the thought of one or all of them leaving me feels like the end of the world to me. There are times when I’m alone and feel lonely and kinda empty if I’m not texting or around a certain friend. All of it is internal codependency as I feel as though I don’t physically show it to my friends, maybe i sometimes do but I don’t see it very much. I’m currently feeling sad and “off” and I think it’s cuz I’m not texting this new friend of mine that I haven’t texted in a couple days other than some short messages back and forth earlier today. I’m actively trying to work on my self esteem and worth to try to combat this codependency, but I sometimes feel like I’m not doing enough or there’s something I could do that would “fix” the codependency directly but don’t know what that would be. I genuinely really want to be able to be internally happy with myself without feeling like I need people’s attention or support to feel loved. Is there anything any of you do to combat codependency directly?",2,2,2025-12-19 07:07:13,AC-Hammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pq8ga7/i_want_to_stop_being_dependent_on_my_friends_for/,mentalhealth,1.0,Opinion / Thoughts,0.9889,0.15213837886251677,0.7864108085632324,-1,0.7203030800541196,1
1pqcxsw,I really am the problem,"I'm just so done. I'm always the last one, I always joke about everything because I don't really know how else to express myself but it only makes others think it doesn't effect me but it does. Ive just been getting worse mentally and have no one to lean on. I don't know if I even want that because then they feel burdened with me. I know what it's like to be the therapist friend and I couldn't put that on someone.

 It stings watching everyone around be or get into relationships without a overwhelming feeling that they are gonna leave you or find you to be to much. To find out that you *are* more then they were bargaining for. 

'Your time will come' when? I have 2 friends. 2! And no one else really is close to me beside a situational friend or someone I know. I know of a lot of people but they don't know me. I really don't think I know myself anymore. I constantly change to fit in but I still am the outcast, the one who isn't invited until I ask if I can come or ask others, the last to know about something, the last choice. 

I just want to be loved. Is that really so hard? Someone who is willing to push through hard times and listen. To understand that I am a lot but they want it as much as I do. They are as obsessed with me as I am them. I'm pretty sure it's just me at this point, I push people away when they get to close because someone is going to be hurt and I can't let it be me.

1pqcw3r,How can one find resolve over this as a teenager?,"I had a relationship that went for about 2 years till , the girl I was in a relationship with genuinely was the sweetest person I'd ever met, but she had been cheated on in her previous relationship.  
Everything was smooth for about a 1 year and 9 months and an instance took place where she got too drunk and kissed another guy (she did apologise that very second and genuinely showed a lot of remorse, mind you, she's always been very committed throughout).  
Due to this breaking a barrier of trust between us, it caused a lot of fights(seems a lil obvious) between us and about 2 weeks earlier she came to the conclusion that she doesn't wanna stay in a relationship cuz she feels fucked up and that we would never get each other's emotions on the topic.  
The whole time i still did try to get us back but she is adamant on never coming back into a relationship.   
*For me, my mind always wanders off to the mindset that she could never leave her ex but cheats and now decides to leave me.*

My mental health during my second year of University was terrible and it did massively affect my studying. I blame myself for not passing the courses and having to retake them.

I lost some of my friends my cycle. My parents are very concerned. They're very caring and I'm very sad to say it. Perhaps I did push them away from me with my behavior. I have been studying very well for the past month and a half for my exam. My exam is exactly 23 days from now. It's very crucial that I get a good grade I have been quite anxious and I can get a sense of my old self coming back and my only concern is not having a good grade and even this good part of myself coming back being buried by another bad grade.

I could never keep friends and the only boyfriend ive ever had only lasted two months and ended really badly because he was drifting from me so I stupidly resorted to sh. Ive tried committing before from losing relationships and im back to shing because I ruined all my relationships At my new job again. This is the longest ive had a depression episode because of it (four months) and im wanting to just give up on ever being normal.

1pqbyr5,I honestly don't know how to hold on anymore.,"I've been in a depressive episode for the past few months, with it getting way worse this month alone. 
I lost my two best friends of 6 years due to them abusing drugs and being unsafe/inappropriate. I had to let them go. There was a lot more but this isn't what the post is about. I also dropped out of school the beginning of the year; I was in a behavioral school; so classes and classrooms were different. I was there due to how bad my anxiety was. I made friends there and got close to certain staff, but absolutely broke last year after one quit and left earlier then he said he would. I was getting bullied for being transgender, and because of the kids religion, they ended up not doing anything except recommending I work in another room; which was not fair to me. So I had to choose between trying to graduate next year because of how far my grades were behind (next year was my best shot even though I would technically stay back still in 12th grade) or I left and focused on myself. At first it was okay; I had So much more time to spend with friends as they both were drops out due to other things in their life. We drove around and did whatever and smoked weed as well. But, unfortunately, when I moved to my new place with my parents a few months later, those friendships ended. All I have now are my emotionally abusive/mentally abusive parents, my wonderful sister and niece I see once a week roughly, and my therapist, psyciatrist, gender care specialist, and my aftercare worker who is leaving due to our services expiering next week. 

So with that in mind, I am finding it hard to find reasons to even live. Every day is the same. I wake up around 9am maybe noon the latest now because of a new sleep med, and I just... Exist. I play a game or do whatever while my parents work; leaving the house at no later than 4am, and not coming back until the latest being 6:30pm and earliest being 5:30. I am alone that whole time; Monday through Friday. I can't go for walks, because its winter and I have asthma and it's fucking cold as shit out. The sidewalks also don't seem to get cleared off that well. I am inside all day every day. I try to at least go out and check the mail. But... Whatever. I do go grocery shopping with my parents once a week, and maybe other shopping for fun once in a while of I beg to go somewhere. I hate how the only places I can go means going with my parents. I want to go with friends... But I have none. I want to go by myself, but I don't have my license or a car yet. I am going insane. I am doing everything I can. But I am getting suicidal. But I won't do anything, because I've tried over and over; and after last year? How mad my mom got? And annoyed? Blaming me? No. I can't. I feel so trapped. I wish I could just fucking die. But I can't even picture a world without me. But I am in so much pain. I have had depression ever since I was fucking 8 and my grandfather died. I am 19. I can't do this much longer. The most I can do is cut. I have no reason to try. I don't like myself. I don't love myself. I won't until I start looking the way I want too; when I start Testosterone. I can't do this much longer. I think? After Christmas? I might just...idk. I am so utterly alone and isolated against my will. This is pain. I can't do this much longer.

1pqbu6g,What is going on,"I’ve been dealing with intense anxiety and a lot of fear around schizophrenia/psychosis, and since that fear started my mind has felt nonstop.

I’m having constant “mind-pops” — random images, brief movie or dream-like clips, and old memories popping into my head 24/7 without me trying to think of them. They’re not hallucinations and I know they’re coming from my own mind, but they’re vivid, intrusive, and really scary. Random memories of me as a child. Random movie clips I watched. Some are blunt and some are blurry. Is this me developing psychosis ??? It’s constant, especially from me as a child. I can name 30 events I remembered today.

It’s worse when I’m tired or trying to sleep, and it’s made me hyper-aware of my thoughts. Along with this I’ve had severe anxiety, poor sleep, racing thoughts, derealization, and loss of appetite.

Doctors haven’t found signs of psychosis so far, but the constant memory and image popping is exhausting and frightening. I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar during intense anxiety, OCD, panic, or medication changes. Maybe the doctors are missing these signs and I’m developing schizophrenia or bipolar. Help.

We’ve just seen that our fish tank has a very small leak. Mr 15 wants to become a YouTuber, potentially leaving school and work.

1pqbgtb,My brain works weird and I don’t like it.,"I came to a scary realization about how my mind works. I don’t think in terms of past, present, and future. I neglect the past, get used to the present, and see what preparations I can make in and for the future.

Which means when someone dies I don’t really grieve, I just get used to their absence. My routine shifts to fill the empty space, and contentedness returns. They become part of the past.

Yes, I remember, but memories are often fuzzy things. Blurry faces, fragments of speech, and descriptions. “I felt happy here.” “This frustrated me.” “I lost my temper here.” “I ended up with this injury at this place.” “I had ___ to eat.”

And I think that’s why photos and souvenirs are so important to me. It captures what my brain can’t, and is a key to clear the mental fog.

What sucks is I can imagine things clearly. Monsters and landscapes and machines. But never people. Never specific locations. It’s always blurry, always jumbled, and it physically hurts if I think on it too hard.

Yes I am diagnosed with audhd and I think that’s part of it, but the lack of sadness and tears at funerals, the numb categorization of memories and “oh well, that sucks” attitude my brain has towards death scares me.",1,0,2025-12-19 09:34:49,UncomfyUnicorn,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pqbgtb/my_brain_works_weird_and_i_dont_like_it/,mentalhealth,1.0,Venting,-0.9851,-0.08559027777777777,-0.6441357135772705,-1,-0.6347159123441908,-1

I don't know why this is happening to me. I opened twitter once and saw one of those gore videos randomly of a woman cutting herself badly, and It aroused me. I couldn't take my eyes off the blood and then I couldn't stop looking at the pain and suffering on that woman's face and that made me more aroused. I don't know what's going on I have dreams of just doing terrible things to people, could be someone I hate or just a random person. I don't know why. It's getting to the point where I'll say something that is in my head to one of my best friends I've known basically my whole life and he'll say ""Your evil."" I've also realized I don't have any to no empathy for anyone other than animals, myself, or my family. Nobody else really matters to me, a girl I knew at school said she was gonna kill herself and my first thought was ""Hope she does free week off school."" I am losing my mind every single day it gets worse, I'm angry everyday I get angry so easily. Multiple times everyday I get angry over little things. I've thought about torturing and murdering people for small inconveniences, I realized it was getting really bad when I imagined murdering my mother for her asking me to plug something in, even though I had just fully relaxed and got comfortable. It was a small minor inconvenience and my brain immediately made me imagine torturing her, and killing her. I had a dream the other night where I used and violated somebody because I could.

I can feel gratitude and happiness for how my life is going but it’s almost like it’s muffled.

1pq613b,Friendship feels like talking to a wall - we just operate so differently,"My friend and I have been close for a while but honestly... sometimes it feels like we're speaking different languages and it's really hard. I'm emotional - I feel things first, figure them out later. He's the opposite - super logical, always in his head.

Some things I've noticed about how he operates:

* When I share something that's bothering me, he immediately tries to explain WHY I feel that way instead of just... hearing me
* He almost never says ""I feel"" - it's always ""I think"" even when we're talking about personal stuff
* Everything needs a reason or explanation - like emotions are a problem to solve
* He seems uncomfortable when things get too emotional, like he doesn't know what to do with it
* Sometimes I get the sense he DOES feel things but it's locked away somewhere he can't reach

I care about him but honestly? Sometimes talking to him feels like talking to a wall. Not because he doesn't care - I know he does - but because he's trying so hard to UNDERSTAND what I'm saying that he doesn't actually FEEL what I'm saying. And that's the part that would make me feel heard.

Curious if anyone here is the ""logical one"" in their relationships. What's that actually like from your side? And if you could change one thing about how you connect with people... what would it be?

Not looking to fix anyone - just genuinely trying to understand so maybe our friendship doesn't have to be this hard.",2,1,2025-12-19 05:14:28,krakjagoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pq613b/friendship_feels_like_talking_to_a_wall_we_just/,mentalhealth,1.0,Question,0.9781,0.05277777777777777,0.0,-1,0.3039855555555555,1
1pq2ops,Something is wrong with me,"I’m 14 years old and I’m still a very sensitive person.
That’s why this situation affects me so deeply.

For the past two years, my dad has been acting very aggressive.
There is frequent yelling, threats, and sometimes physical behavior.
Living in this environment makes me feel constantly stressed and unsafe.

Before this started, I was calm, empathetic, and not aggressive at all.
I cared a lot about people and avoided conflict.
But after years of fear and arguments at home, something changed in me.

I started experiencing intrusive thoughts that I never had before.
They are unwanted and disturbing, and I don’t want to act on them.
They feel like random “what if” thoughts that appear suddenly,
and they scare me because they don’t reflect who I really am.

Sometimes, when my dad intimidates or disrespects me,
I feel a strong urge to defend myself or fight back.
I want to hurt him and make him feel the pain that he gave me, i want him to finally understand and respect me.
but I feel powerless and cornered.
Realistically, I know I don’t stand a chance against him,
which makes the situation even more frustrating and scary.

I also get angry much faster than I used to,
and I hate that about myself.
I don’t enjoy feeling this way and I don’t want to hurt anyone.

I believe these changes are a reaction to long-term stress,
fear, and living in a hostile household.
It feels like my brain is stuck in survival mode.

I’m writing this because I need help and understanding.
I want to feel like myself again.
I want to learn how to handle intrusive thoughts,
manage anger caused by long-term stress,
and stay mentally safe while living in a toxic home.

or has advice on how to cope,
I would really appreciate it.",3,1,2025-12-19 02:54:46,Unfair_Yogurt_5246,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pq2ops/something_is_wrong_with_me/,mentalhealth,1.0,Content Warning: Violence,-0.9939,-0.019555555555555562,-0.8067100048065186,-1,-0.7054361135143703,-1

1pqa8w7,school sucks,"Back in October, my sleep schedule was flipped around—sleeping during the day and awake all night. I used to have a great schedule for my online school; wake up at 9:30am, make a cup of hot chocolate, attend my morning meetings, do all my lessons, and get off a few hours later to relax the rest of the day. That one week of sleeping all day gave me over 30 missing assignments. I couldn’t get caught up. 

It’s now the last day before break and I have 35+ missing assignments. I’ve been almost caught up, then took a break and got back where I started. It’s so draining, having so much work to do. My dad has started doing schoolwork for me so I won’t get kicked out of my school, and I feel so fucking guilty for making him do my schoolwork when he’s already so stressed with his boss and finances and our pets and my family. 

I ended up relapsing a few days ago. It wasn’t planned; my dad had given me a callus remover set, or whatever you want to call it. It contained one of those electric grinders to remove the dead skin, since I inherited my parent’s dry skin. Also in the pack was other tools—files, tweezers, all that stuff, and it contained a 3-pack of razors to refill a razor callus remover or whatever you call them (a small tool with a razor that cuts dead skin off, you’ve probably seen a TikTok or video with one). 

I never planned on relapsing, but I had a chance and took it. I used that to harm myself once, and it’s just escalated. I’ve relapsed so many times over the past few days, and the amount of times I’ve considered killing myself isn’t healthy. I know I can’t, I couldn’t if I had the chance because I can’t abandon my cats like that. There’s so many things piling onto my struggles. My now ex-friend causing drama, jealousy, being irritable, and just everything hurts. I really don’t know what to do with my life. I feel like committing.

1pq9kly,Is it normal to forget major life stuff after anxiety / panic attacks? Need support,"I am posting here because of anonymity. I have never talked about this to anyone in my life and I am scared to talk about it openly.

Usually after a major anxiety or panic attack (kind of existential crisis type), I forget a lot of major life stuff. I still remember basic things like my name, family, very close friends, my studies and hobbies. But I forget deeper things, like important life learnings, lessons I learned as a child, and experiences that shaped me.

This happens every 3–4 months. After such episodes, I don’t remember friends I have lost touch with for a few months or more, like completely. I also forget lessons I had learned before that time. Sometimes these memories come back randomly, but most of the time they don’t.

Because of this, I keep repeating the same big mistakes in life. These are not small things, but major life-changing events. I only realize later that I have done the same things again, almost as if I never learned from them. I also forget people and relationships that were once important to me.

I feel this might be some kind of defense mechanism from my childhood, because of some traumatic events back then. But I don’t know if this is normal or if other people experience this too. Since I never talked about it before, I really don’t know.

1pq46s2,"I need to cry, But I don't","I don't know if anyone else is like this but I want to cry so often and honestly, I really need to but subconsciously, I stop myself from shedding a single tear. I don't know why this is and honestly it's a very normal thing for me. Heck, when my grandfather died and everyone was crying and mourning, I just, didnt cry at all. Instead I just watched Mamma Mia 2 after playing my most favourite game from my childhood. I am generally a very unfeeling person, I just don't care about anything, Even though I do try to care in a sense. 

Let me clarify with what I mean

So, it's kinda hard to explain, but, It's like I do know about morality, I do know right from wrong and I do know what being considered is. I often help where I can, I'm always nice to everyone I talk to in person, I'm always just trying to be my best self. Though underneath it all, when it comes to actual feelings, like feeling appreciative, thankful, felling love for someone or empathy and remorse, I often struggle with all of it. I don't know what it feels like to love someone genuinlyfrom my heart, I don't feel butterflies, or like my heart is flying and full of life, it's generally just, flat lined in a sense. Same with thankfulness or appreciation, where I have a lot to be thankful for but I don't feel thankfull, and when someone does something nice for me or gives me a gift or hug or whatever, I just feel neutral, unchanged. I don't know how to appreciate things. Yet I try my very best to show appreciation or thankfulness. I try to make the other person feel like they made a difference. I don't wanna ruin the feeling people get from doing something big for someone else. 

There is probably some medical term for me, though in all honesty, knowing what it is isn't going to change the way I am and was born. I just wonder, is it because I've not been in a position to start feeling things genuinely, or that maybe I just didn't develop myself properly. A fact about me is, in highschool, I was really uncaring, yet pretend caring for the sake of others, I wasn't a normal teenager as I should've been, I wasn't moody, I wasn't finding myself, I wasn't trying to prove anything to anyone, I just was neutral through it all. It's honestly like I myself suppressed my own puberty, in which I missed developing the means to have feelings for real.

In all honesty, I do still feel emotions, like happy, sad, mad, you know, the basic stuff, although some are more prominent than others like sadness, fear, anger, jealousy, wanting, desire, envy. All of these are still present and at the moment of typing all this, I just feel empty. Like a shell with no host. 

I have always wanted to feel love, to find my future wife, to settle down and have kids. I have wanted this for a long time, and not having any of that, while I'm 25 now, with everyone I know around me already married and with families, I can't help but feel left out.

This is why I need to cry, I need to rage, I need to resolve my inner conflicts, I need to let go of my desires and my wants. Yet I can't. I don't know how to. I just don't know what to do, or I don't know what could fix me. 

I just, want to be normal.

Yet, despite it all, I'm putting up a facade subconsciously, and even though I try to do good, and say thank you and try to make others happy and try to reassure people of their goodness, I am just all around neutral feeling. It frustrates me so much.

This includes metabolites like norquetiapine, as well as Cogentin, Zyprexa, Clozapine, and Paxil. 

Under what circumstances is it ethical to impair someone's memory? Is a career worth preserving? What about a hobby, or an autism-associated circumscribed interest? Could it actually be worth knocking certain memories, bodies of knowledges, or mental imagery out of people's brains? 

Also, have you considered that two patients with the same broad profession or hobby can have different needs? Programmer A is a ""code monkey"" doing rote tasks, mostly filling in the blanks in a very linear script. Programmer B has to keep a mental model of the system they're programming for, if not designing, and does a lot more ""roundabout"" work and complex data structures and algorithms.  

And programmer C is a hobbyist who programs for the Arduino microcontroller platform. These projects can be quite esoteric. But because they aren't monetized and perhaps count towards ""unhealthy screen time,"" they are perhaps not taken seriously.

I feel ashamed to admit this because every time ive bought this up irl people just look at me weird, i thought it was normal but i feel like im the only one.

Ive jerked off pretty much since i found out i had a working knob, but over the past 3-4 years, in my adult working life, i experience this sensation of if i dont orgasm within a 3-4 day period, my mood gets worse, im more irritable, i cant focus, i get headaches, im lazy, i obsess over sex/masturbation and my sleep gets effected.

Its really annoying, as I recently broke up with my GF, we only went out for a about a year, however during that time (OCT 2024- OCT 2025) i lost my virginity and it was great, however the relationship wasnt, hence why i ended it. We would have sex 3-4 times a week, so i was feeling great, and now ive not had sex in a few months, ive felt like absolute crap.

Masturbation helps a bit, but im really just craving the feeling of sex, and the fun that comes with it. Ive considered prostitutes, but i live with my parents still and they are expensive and not local to me.

Ive tried dating apps (i wasnt expecting anything) and that came up blank (Duh) and women in the real world just dont see me as anything other than a bit weird.

Ive considered going to a medical professional, but i dont want to be perked up on anti depressants because im not depressed within myself, im just extremely horny, all i can think about is sex, sexual things, having sex with people and just things that really dont belong in my everyday life.

I feel like a bad person, no one else ive spoken to about it seems to understand, and i feel like something is wrong with me.

1pq8e7i,I’ve just never been happy…,"There was never a time where I was genuinely happy about something. I’m not kidding. Even in the times that I appeared to be happy, I was just doing it to not ruin the social environment/mood. There is nothing that I truly enjoy.

There is no “I used to enjoy doing x, y, and z, and I just can’t anymore.” I mean I have never enjoyed doing anything, period.

It causes me a lot of distress sometimes because I’ve just started college (I’m 19), and I can’t afford to not have a direction in life. I don’t have any desire or purpose to work, but I need to figure something out now before I become a useless hobo. The thing is that I can’t force myself to work towards something I don’t see myself enjoying. It burns me out and leaves me with more stress and anxiety. This first semester of college was a testament to that.

I also haven’t had any real friends. Nobody my age ever expresses a desire to be near me. All I have are friendly acquaintances that say hello, but that’s it. It’s been that way since childhood. I don’t have anyone to look after me or “see” me.

And there is no real reason behind my shitty mental health, either. I have two loving parents and a good home environment, I made straight A’s in high school, I have good physical health, and I have everything I need to be successful. Yet, I’m always numb, sad, or neutral at best.

I just thought I might share this with someone, even if it is online. No one else seems to have this problem. There are people who seem to lose their joy, but I never see anyone who just never had joy to begin with. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember.

For the record, I am not suicidal, and I never have been. I just can’t find a way to get past this, no matter how hard I try or how many angles I attack this from. The pressure is on me to find something to live for before I become consumed by mental exhaustion and hopelessness.

But for the last few years, the focus was always my life in general,about my social abilities, my confidence etc. I have seen some positive changes in myself, and I know I would be way worse without it. It at least stabilizes me. However, lately I have been having a way harder time battling my emotions whenever I am about to sleep. My schedule got messed up, I am at a freeze mode because I'm overwhelmed and when I'm not I'm just crying. So I have been thinking of seeing a psychiatrist. Yet, my therapists always put me off that direction whenever I mention I am seriously worried about my state. So I fear I am being overly dramatic somehow.

1pq808q,Am I a horrible person?,"I 46f, have been pushing my husband away for the 26 years we were married. I did not have a good childhood,  most people don't, but we met at age 19 and have been together ever since then. We moved in together after 1 year and from the start I pushed him away emotionally. I would use weaponized incompetence and try to be in charge when I wanted to and made him take responsibility whenever I did not.

We had 2 years when I did not do it but I stopped about 18 years ago. I wish I could say why, our relationship was wonderful and our communication was so easy. 

A few years ago he got to what I would call a breaking point. I was extremely stressful and ignored him and his concerns. He finally asked me to leave. The last few years I have talked myself back into the house and relationship what feels like a hundred times, and I did nothing to change. 

2 and a half months ago I stopped the abuse and we had a wonderful 2 months. Then 2 weeks ago I went right back to my old habits. I started a fight and he asked me to leave. I talked my way back in again and the last 2 weeks have been a huge roller coaster. 

Why can't I stop? I know i am lazy about change and like most people I want things my way, but I can't stop and I am losing the only person I love. 

Am I evil? What is wrong with me? I am treating him like my mother treats my father and I understand it is extremely abusive. I understand I get it partly from her but my husband has been trying so hard to help me stop and I won't.  

I don't understand why it is when we have a disagreement I blow it up and gaslight him or lie. I don't want to think I want this but do I? I am so miserable without him but if I do not stop what does that say? 

We don't agree with couple therapy because it is so difficult for the therapist not to take sides and I can not afford therapy.

1pq7p8y,Why? How? Lost.,"My only use in life ever has always to be a cliff for people whose problems are more important than mine. The only friendships and relationships I have ever been in. M21. In all my years. I have been discarded every time as quickly as I lost my usefulness to them. They either got better. Moved away. Or got new friends.

And everytime when it happened. I was not even suprised. It became so damn predictable. I could feel the people who got better. Separate from me. They talked less. Responded slower. Physically moved away from me anytime we were next to eachother. It started slowly. a few inches further away. A few less words. A few more minutes until they responded. And then gone. Never looked my way. Never texted me. NEVER gave a shit.

They never liked me. Outside family. Noone likes me. I have been in 3 relationships in all my life. All of them cheated on me. They never loved me. They never would. I was about as useful as vinyl gloves. I got used until not needed then thrown away.

I literally got asked by a drunk person 2 days ago how I felt. I literally could not explain it. I could not utter it. I could not show it. I stood there for 2 minutes with an open mouth. Not knowing what to say.

Do I even have a right to tell people about how I work. What I feel. When simply. They don't listen, they don't put it in mind. It is a passing ghost on a train. Never to be seen again. Never acknowledged. Do I not deserve to have feelings?

Everytime i told about how people made me feel. It got twisted to me being wrong. To me being this or that. And noone looked deeper to see how it actually was. It was taken at face value and denied. I get villified everywhere I go. I stopped helping a girl because i needed a break from life. And she spread heinous rumors. Noone cared to ask me if it was true. People just moved on. Moved away.

There is noone left to show me what kindness is outside familial relations. They are the only ones who got my back. They are the only ones who care. But even then. To put all that on them. It's unfair. I get that I should. But I can't. I simply can't

  
I give this world all the things I want for me. I have helped people from ending it all. I have helped people from doing irreparable damage to themselves or someone else. But Never have I gotten that mercy. That care. That happiness from the world. I believed in karma and yin and yang. But i never got my fair dues. I got a mental deficiency. Nerve damage. ASPD. Countless scars (not from self harm. Simply from being unlucky) And very. VERY few good small things.

1pq2efk,I have never felt 'right' in my body.,"I hate being a woman. From everything such as my whiny, high-pitched voice, to my boobs, to my period, to my entire build. I hate being perceived as a woman. I hate the fact that, in some 20 odd years - give or take - I will unfortunately go through menopause. A fate worse than death for myself. I would honestly rather die than go through that.

I have wished, since I became aware of my 'woman-ness' when I was around 14, that I was a dude. So it's been 10 years of thinking that way. In the past I've identified as non-binary and also a trans dude, but never stuck with it because it ended up never feeling right. I have never felt comfortable in my skin no matter what I have done with/to myself. I have been overweight, I have been underweight, I have gone to the gym. I've had long hair, I've had short hair, I even had a buzzcut. I've had a trillion different styles and tried a plethora of different 'cores'. I've gotten a million piercings, and removed all of them because NOTHING has ever worked. Nothing's ever made me feel normal or made me able to identify with any part of myself. Every time I look at myself whether it be in a photo, or a mirror, or a windowed reflection, I see something different. It could be 30 seconds apart and I'd see something different each time.

I wish I could just wake up a dude. But not a dude in this family because I'd be chopped as fuck. I already am chopped but I think my one saving grace from being a complete dreg is that I am a woman. As unfortunate as being a woman is lmao.

I am not transgender. Anytime I post online about hating being a woman I am met with, ""You are transgender"" or ""a lot of trans people don't wanna transition but then end up doing so"" I'M NOT TRANS!!!!!!! Nothing wrong with being trans. Shout out to all ya'll trans homies ya'll are the best. But I am not transgender. I would rather die than transition. I just wanna wake up a dude. Like I wanna custom create my character. And pls don't say 'oh but you can do that just dye ur hair and wear what u wanna haha' NOT IN THAT WAY I MEAN MY WHOLE FACE, MY HAIR, MY BRAIN, MY BONE STRUCTURE. EVERYTHING. I like not one single thing about myself. And cannot identify with this body I am trapped inside of. In my head I look massively different from how I look in real life. And I think I should die because of it. I know it will only get worse as time progresses, because I have noticed it getting worse. 'It' being my appearance.

1ppyd0w,I'm so glad I havent killed myself yet,"It's been five months since I broke up with my ex gf of two years who forced me to cut contact with our friends (we're in the same friend group) which is maybe because of her insecurities developed from unresolved childhood trauma by threatening tk kill herself . I wasn't able to communicate with them for almost two years. She gradually lost interest with me and neglected my needs for affection for the last year of our relationship. The isolation caused me to constantly seek for validation and attention since she's the only person I'm forced to rely on.

For three months after we broke up, I was really lost since I have no one close enough to vent out since she also prevented me from making new friends why is pretty shit for me who was a freshman at that time. She also tries to make me jealous by saying that she has a lot of new friends to hang out with. 

Recently, I was able to reconnect with some of my friends who I was forced to cut off. I'm forever grateful to them that they gave a chance to start anew and are very undersranding of my situation. 

If I killed myself back in October out of sheer loneliness and isolation, I wouldn't have been able to reconcile with most of my old friends.

Right now it’s a struggle to do anything. Even basic things are challenging like work, eating, socializing, and the quality that I’m doing those things is pretty abysmal. My work performance is bare minimum, my eating has me on a fine line between underweight and needing hospitalization, and socially I barely go outside and when I do I don’t speak.

Now, even though I’m doing all of these things really poorly, I’m still able to do them, so that’s good at least.

My main issue though, is that I feel like I have zero motivation for anything. I have no reason to get up in the morning. I just feel completely empty and devoid of meaning.

Yeah sure I will work, to get money, so I don’t have to sleep outside. Yeah sure I’ll eat food, so I don’t end up hospitalized. Yeah sure I’ll go to grad school, to get a better job, to keep being sad in my home.

Idk. I guess I’m able to function, although at a severely reduced capacity.

But every single day I just feel emptiness. I’ve always have very nihilistic views on life since I was a kid, but I guess I always hoped I was wrong. The only time I’ve ever felt good is when I was distracted enough. But I’ve just came to this point where I don’t get it, do I just need to distract myself and pretend this all makes complete sense? Like that’s crazy man, and I’ve done it, and it doesn’t last forever and when you come out on the other side that original problem is always worse because all you did was ignore it. Maybe I’m wrong idk.

I just don’t see a point. At 19 I got really into philosophy, psychology, and psychedelics, and tried to make sense of life as much as I could. At 21 I told myself the best answer I’m getting is just trying to live life to the fullest is the only point of life. And I tried to do that.

But now at 28, after a lot of hard years, I’ve found myself at the same place I was as a 10 year old kid. What’s the point? If there’s no point, and the point is just to live life to the fullest, and that life is full of hells, then what’s the point? Even if my life was incredible with no problems, if there ever was a day where I wasn’t distracted, I think I’d very likely have these same thoughts, because my concern that life is pointless has been with me since childhood.",3,3,2025-12-18 23:54:23,One_Egg_9177,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ppy3w3/struggling_to_find_motivation/,mentalhealth,1.0,Question,-0.8859,0.10824383949383949,-0.8762751817703247,1,-0.6822588229863944,-1
1pq1h0i,I have to present an argument that my anxiety impacted my school and I'm terrified :(,"TW: brief mention of suicidal ideation 

I failed one of my 5 classes this semester, and I know my anxiety was impacting me tremendously.  But I am not sure how to communicate that in a way that an admin is going to care about.

This year was cursed, 4 family deaths within 6 months, plus long term partner breaking up with me, best friend having a falling out, and parents kicking me out.

I basically lost 8 people in a very short time frame, and wanted to end things many times but I kept fighting and managed to pass 4/5 courses.  I know my anxiety was making me break down many days, being unable to do much but cry in bed.  I don't know how to prove this, is this even a valid reason?

I am not sure if I deserve another chance or not.  My argument was that my anxiety was preventing me from doing work many days but I don't know if that would suffice.

I have been trying to talk to the few friends that were nice and understanding ,but they too have grown apart from me even though I try my best to talk to them,but now it's been a month and I've asked them if they wanted to hangout or if they are busy but they didn't respond to me,and now today i saw a bunch of my friends out (mind you we made amends so i didn't understand )and nobody told me ,literally everyone was there and i wasn't ,they weren't there for me when i needed them and they rejected me ,i can't help but have this heavy feeling on me ,i don't have friends anymore ,i have a boyfriend though ,he's sweet ,but he's got friends and they want to hang out with him ,i can't hold him back or make him feel as if he shouldn't go out with his friends cause i have nk one even if it hurts me .

I hate that i don't have them ,it feels like i was nothing to them like they replaced me ,abd now they are happy ,i feel like i was the problem ,when geniuenly i always looked out for them.

I only know is that i wouldn't of done it to them and i just feel sad and tired.My bf isn't helpful when it comes to talking about this ,especially if it's not in person and i don't know how to pull myself out of this slump im in ,i hate myself for having mental issues ,i think if i didn't have a problem maybe id still have friends , does anyone have any sort of advice to feel better about how i feel ,cause it's been a few months I've been feeling this and today just got worse and i just want to get over this feeling .",2,5,2025-12-19 02:03:12,Corpsedecaying,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pq1eoo/i_need_advice/,mentalhealth,1.0,Sadness / Grief,0.8778,-0.06216931216931218,-0.6327641606330872,1,-0.06547594275040602,0
1pq6qf3,19 and lost,"This semester I failed chem. I'm a sophomore in community college and I'm trying to finish my prerequisites for nursing. This is the first class I've failed and I feel disappointed in myself but also just this deep sadness I can't shake off. Growing up I've never felt an intense passion for career pathways, I have just known I'm decent in sciences, arts, and english. When the time came around for college I chose nursing because it made the most sense to me. My mom's a nurse, I was in a biomedical program in high school, I feel that I'm a caring person, and the career is respectable/ a steady gateway into the medical field. Now that I'm taking these classes I'm not sure if I'm capable of this, which makes me feel stupid and silly. growing up my mom didn't have much and she's done so much to provide my siblings and I with a wonderful home and an amazing life. I feel like a major let down not being the smartest or the kind of daughter that I wish to be. Despite putting myself in school and having a job I still feel like a loser, a phony, and a dissapointment. I don't know what I should do with myself and it makes me frustrated. These past year has felt so exhausting because I know I'm struggling but I'm having a hard time finding out what to do and asking for help. I've always felt so afraid to ask for help in any way because I feel I'll look dumb or that I don't deserve it and should figure it out on my own. I keep trying to remind myself I'm only 19 but it's hard to try and imagine a version of myself who is confident and knows herself. If anyone has ever felt this way or similar and is doing good now it'd be nice to hear that it'll all be okay. Thank you to any one who reads this.

We obviously spoke about it at the time and  also read some things about it online, some of which was quite scary if I’m honest. I really do love him and so I really do not want to be judgemental or anything especially bc I struggle with mental health too. It just a little jarring when that mental health problem is sociopathy. 

Am I being crazy for feeling weird about it? He said that he understands why I feel a little weird given how the media depicts people with ASPD, so I really appreciate him not holding my initial reaction against me. I think maybe I’m also just blindsided bc he doesn’t seem like what I’d envision a sociopath to be like.

1pq62l9,How long did it take for you to recover after mental health collapse?,"Hi! (27,F) i'm curious to hear from people who've been through it before. 

Ive struggled with GAD and MDD since i was a kid, put on meds and in therapy since then. I was hospitalized once at 12 but managed to keeping moving forward and pick myself back up every time fell backwards until this summer when i hit the lowest point of my life, eventually landing in the hospital for 20 days in August. I stepped down into PHP for a few weeks and am currently in a Trauma IOP doing EMDR. I was diagnosed with PTSD (My treatment team says its CPTSD but i live in America so ""PTSD, chronic"" is the closest thing) and panic disorder. Im on 6 frickin psych meds, thankfully the cocktail is doing an okay job at managing my symptoms and i'm exhausted and rather unproductive but not stuck in fight/flight or crisis most days. 

4 months in now, My wife is also struggling immensely as a lot of the responsibilities fell on her, having to constantly be worried about me, etc. We had an argument the other day and she asked how much longer is this going to go on for, and I really feel her frustration and its not fair for her at all, i wish i could just wake up one day and be fixed. I do my best to be the best partner i can be. My capacity is limited and we are both wearing thin. During my last 1 on 1 with my IOP therapist, i asked how long till i'm back to being a functional person and of course she didn't give me a real answer. I understand its going to take as long as it takes and i just have to show up everyday, 'not die', and one day it'll get better.

1pq5w0r,Why do I sometimes get these permanent mindset shifts?,"For context, before 2015 I wasn’t in a good place socially or academically. I dealt with bullying and mostly played video games. One day, during a crossbar challenge with my pal, something just clicked. I felt an unbreakable conviction that let me drop old baggage, fix my grades, get in shape, beat up (some) of my bullies, and ride that momentum for years.

After college, that invincible feeling went away. Everything felt forced, and I realized I wasn’t invincible. Then this year, after a serious back injury, I had another “click,” but in the opposite direction. I felt disillusioned and not driven. 

I questioned my goals and relationships and realized I mostly wanted to be left alone and live on my own terms, which turned me into a hermit and led me to cut people off without thinking (like, at all).

Both shifts felt natural, like something from the Heavens came down and delivered this to me as a gift. There was no “I need to change” or “I can’t do this anymore,” but a sudden realignment where things just clicked and I went with the flow.

1pq5rxq,Im heartbroken and I dont want to neglect myself.,"I am a 21 year old female who just got out of her first long time relationship 3.5 years to be exact.  Its only been a day since this happend so its very fresh on my mind.  But I miss him so much, he was my whole world and I am willing to do anything for this man.  Since we have been together we have been on survival mode.  I was very mentally unwell and depressed for most of our relationship and due to that I couldn't keep up my part of adulthood.  I put so much pressure on this man because I couldn't accept that I needed professional help.  We couldn't create a deep bond because I was so emotionally absent in the relationship.  And if you are into the whole personality thing I am isfj and he is enfj.  This is something that was discussed towards the end of our relationship.  We have very conflicting personalities, he is someone who needs a deep emotional connection where I need someone who is physically their for me.  I was always really bad at reading how he is feeling or understanding the way he thinks and all of these differences led us to split.  I just wish I was their for him more.  I have so much guilt and I want to fix things.  I have been consistently going to therapy for about a month and a half now trying to fix the relationship since I had accepted i needed help or my relationship would crumble and it did.  I just want to be healthy but im so devastated I cant sleep or eat.  All I can think about is him and how bad I want to fix this.  He has always been their for me and supported us through my hardest times.  He keeps telling me that if I was mentally healthy that I wouldn't want to be with him but I dont think that's true and I dont want him thinking that.  I cant imagine myself with anyone else he is just so smart, artistic, and talented.  Not to mention how caring he use to be to me.  I just want to fix things and start new but I dont know where to start.  We both agree that we need time apart to find ourselves and heal but im afraid that even if im happier with myself and healthy that he may not want to mend things.  I dont want to loose him, im trying to give him space and its taking everything in me to not reach out to him.  I just want to hear his voice.

1pq5fey,mental health.,"hi everyone, i felt as if i was doing pretty decent anxiety wise, but, the last few days i felt like everything came crashing down around me…

i have been off of my daily anxiety medication (lexapro) since august. i was diagnosed these meds for anxiety and ocd, and, prior to this, i had been on 3 different anxiety medications since i was 12 years of age (i’m 20 now.) this is my first time coming off, and staying off of my daily medication. the only other mental health medication i take is klonopin, and that is only as needed (roughly two times a week.)

the last week or so, i’ve been noticing a few things that i haven’t noticed before, including… getting distracted easily, not wanting to finish tasks i used to enjoy (making tiktoks and edits, etc), staring off more especially while thinking, forgetting what i was saying more, jumbling words and sentences together more, having to reread words when reading posts, having to stop and think about what i’m saying more and not being able to do two things at once, there may be more, but, idk. 

i also noticed a few ‘not brain’ symptoms, like late at night, especially while driving, i’m seeing more shadows and things that aren’t there (not hallucinations, but, weird small flashes of light and different things.) and some tingling feelings in my ear/head… which makes me even more worried it’s something physical, or more ‘severe’ mentally…

i feel like these symptoms aren’t super major, and i tend to fix what i messed up quite fast, but, since i have health anxiety, i pick up on them more often, and my brain instantly thinks that there’s something more wrong with me (psychosis, schizophrenia, a tumor, seizures, etc) instead of just thinking it may be because i’m off of the lexapro.

sometimes i feel like my brain is faster than my mouth, which makes my words come out all jumbled and mixed up. i was diagnosed with ADD back in january, during an autism assessment test. i didn’t take this seriously because i felt as if the doctor was not professional, but, looking back on it now, i’m wondering if my lexapro (and the other medicines i’ve been on) masked the symptoms of ADD for me, and now that i’m off of it, the symptoms are here… it’s just confusing on why i’m noticing them now, 5 months after fully getting off of the meds… (when i first got off i was so so anxious and my ocd was at an all time high.)

1pq54fw,How to help mum deal with her father’s death,"Hello dear community. 

My (23f) family is currently struggling with an incoming death of my grandfather and my mum’s dad. He has been sick for many years now. This year it has gotten worse and we sadly expect him to pass away very soon (probably the next couple of days to weeks). 

My mum and grandpa have a very good relationship and she loves him very much. So much that when his health declined, she drove back and forth thousands of kilometres between the two countries we live in just so that she could take care of him. 

We know he will be gone soon. We have known for quite some time but I’m not sure it’s something one can really prepare for. My question is: how can I support my mum through this very tough time? She is honestly my best friend and my heart breaks when I see her like this. 

Before you suggest therapy: due to our background I am 100% sure she would not even consider seeing a therapist.

1pq52kt,18yo volleyball athlete stepping back due to injuries & burnout — how do I come back stronger?,"Hi everyone,  
I’m an 18-year-old international volleyball athlete and I’m really struggling mentally right now. I’d appreciate any advice from people who’ve been through injuries, burnout, or tough coach relationships.

For the past months I’ve been dealing with multiple injuries — currently a hernia, and before that other issues that kept me from playing properly. Despite this, my coaches have consistently pushed me to keep training and competing through pain. Even the physios seem focused only on getting me back on the court as fast as possible, not on long-term health. All I’ve wanted is to slow things down and actually heal.

Because of this, my motivation has completely dropped. I love volleyball, but I’ve been mentally exhausted and disconnected for months. I recently made the really hard decision to move back in with my parents and step away from playing internationally. I still play nationally, but this step back feels huge and honestly pretty scary.

What makes it harder is that all my friends are where I used to live. Leaving them behind has been painful. Back home I feel lonely — not in a dramatic way, but enough that it weighs on me. I don’t regret prioritizing my health, but emotionally I’m struggling.

My questions are:

* How do you mentally deal with stepping back when your identity is so tied to your sport?
* How do you come back stronger after injuries *and* losing trust in coaches/medical staff?
* How do you handle loneliness after leaving a big part of your life behind?
* How do you rebuild motivation when you feel worn down rather than hungry?

I know I’m young, but this has been one of the hardest periods of my life. Any advice, personal experiences, or perspective would mean a lot.

I met a girl and thought everything will be alright but she ghosted me suddenly, so I have no luck in anything. My friends invited me to cinema and I couldn’t go because I was working and this happened three times. I am heartbroken. I just want to live my life like others.

I’m tired of being tired and I know that’s something everyone can relate to but dammit and I being tired of being tired. I feel like I lost myself. I feel like I don’t amount to shit in life and if I’m still being honest, I’ve been nothing but trouble since I could even remember. I feel like God, doesn’t want to show me the way and I’ve been counting on his since I was a youngster. I feel like my mind won’t let me okay. Part of me wishes that nun of this is me and that I’m secretly in a coma, living day to day life and I’d wake up soon but I’ve been waiting to wake since 2006 and I was born in 2001. Idk what to do anymore, please tell me how you achieve this. How do you get over the struggles? Im a stay at home but my family isn’t the problem. It’s me and I feel like I need a stay at home job to keep my mind busy but it’s hard to get one because I have a class B misdemeanor for theft and honestly it’s embarrassing and nothing that I’m proud of. I know I shouldn’t put this on social media, but I’m in a low place right now and I feel like I just need to get everything off my chest. The reason why I have a class being misdemeanor of stuff is because my county had a really bad hurricane come through. We had no electricity no generators there’s hardly even gas. We had no food in the house already but the food that we did have was in the fridge and again we didn’t have electricity so the food went bad so I went to Walmart and I stole food. That way my kids can eat my family myself. I’ve been on probation for more than a year now and I should be getting off of probation, February or March. Again, I’m not proud of it. It’s not something that I would definitely do again, but I don’t regret trying to get food on my kids bellies. (Also I don’t know if I noted this, but I didn’t have money and I still don’t know how I didn’t even come for money and I know what everyone’s going to tell me you try to get food stamps but honestly, if I’m being honest, I did have food stamps and then they cut me off because I was doing DoorDash and now I can’t even make money on DoorDash because of my class being misdemeanor so I don’t know what to do anymore.

1pq42aq,I feel so torn,"My boyfriend (31) and myself (35) have been together just about 2 years. When we met I had undiagnosed health issues.. Nov 2024 my insides exploded and I had emergency surgery, while they were in there they found a tumor and scheduled the whipple surgery Jan 21,25. I was hospitalized after that due to many complications.. I have almost died 5 different times during this year, I have fought hard to stay alive… I told him if I have cancer that I would leave him cause who wants to be with someone so sick. Well, turns out I have cancer.. he wouldn’t let me leave him, so we stayed together. Recovery from there was hard mentally and physically for everyone helping me, it was so rough cause none of us had to ever deal with something like this before.. 
Recently my boyfriend was acting very shady with his phone, so I got suspicious that he may be cheating on me, I decided to go through his phone (I know, shame on me) I don’t want to, I don’t want to feel like I have to either. 
I didn’t see any evidence of him talking to other women… it was worse…. His mother was saying awful things about me. as I read through their texts my heart sank, it shattered.. I felt so betrayed that he let this woman say these horrible things and didn’t stand up for me. I confronted him about it, he didn’t apologize to me.. later we got in a huge fight about it because I blocked her on everything, he said “well how about unblock her and make things right”… 
I’ve done nothing to this woman, I’ve always been nice to her when we saw her, I’ve texted her back when she would freak out that he wasn’t replying to her… 
Now, he’s been acting like everything is normal, like this isn’t a BIG deal when it absolutely is.. 
I love this man with everything in me, but I feel so disrespected.. 
Here are the things she said about me that I have seen, not everything she’s said about me before, cause this isn’t the first time she’s made comments like this. 
“she’s controlling” 
“I just don’t want this to be your whole life, her always being sick,you having to pay for everything, you always have to take care of her, I just didn’t want this for you, but I can’t pick your partner lol.

1ppx8qk,Killing my Twin was a Catalyst to my Mental Health Struggles,"When I was probably about 9 years old, my mum had told me about her pregnancies. She told me that she falls pregnant extremely easily but had ovary issues. This caused miscarriage. She’s been pregnant about 15 times maybe more in her life most didn’t make it past 3 weeks. She only had me and my sister. The later miscarriages were the ones just before me and my sister. Dr said it was kinda like her body getting ready to have a baby by (morbid I know) practising by developing and miscarrying a foetus first.

But she told me when she had me, she had another miscarriage at about 10 weeks and when she was still feeling okay and went to Dr a week later she was still pregnant and it was me. She had vanishing twin syndrome but in its later stage so was a miscarriage not an absorption like most.

So basically, I killed my twin - more common that people realise I know, but have thought for a while that not having my twin is even just a small part of my severe mental illness.

I have severe depression, GAD, ADHD and Autism and also not diagnosed but heavily suspect Borderline Personality Disorder. Especially fearing abandonment. And this is certainly a pretty obvious kicker!

I pretty much killed them I know it’s just Darwinian but like, a twin is the closest human connection in the world they are literally you, they’re a soulmate. Vanishing twin is most common in identical twins too so that’s even worse. I killed the only person who would ever truly understand me. I was abandoned literally before birth, and it was kinda my fault!

I’ve been suicidal since the age of 7.

Whenever I do the right thing (such as cleaning, exercise, extra reading at work) I immediately feel like I am doing the wrong thing and like I am a bad person and that I need to stop what I am doing. Even though I logically know I am doing the right thing.

Has anyone else had this issue with feeling guilt every time you try to do something constructive.

1ppx1c2,Does anyone else feel exhausted just from existing?,"Lately I feel tired in a way that sleep doesn’t fix. Not just physically, but mentally. Like my mind is always “on” even when nothing is happening.
I go through my days doing what I need to do, but inside I feel drained and disconnected. Small things feel heavy, and resting comes with guilt instead of relief.
I’m not in danger, I’m just worn down and trying to understand myself better.
If anyone else feels this quiet kind of exhaustion, how do you cope with it?

1ppopmq,Should I go for ECT (again) ?,"Hello. My story is long.  
  
As a toddler, I was severely sexually, physically, and emotionally abused and mistreated. I remember being in a psychiatric hospital when I was 7 and having ECT. ...  
  
That, of course, does something to the brain, especially to memory, in a child. And it ultimately contributes to complex PTSD, in my opinion. ...  
  
Now, as an adult, I have ongoing problems with catatonia and severe physical depression. I've also been living far away from my relatives for a few years now because I remember everything and can no longer easily be around them.  
  
I am making new connections, but this condition, and this pain, is like torture. ... And I have no one I can talk to about it. I do have a psychiatrist (I also take medication for depression), but somehow I only ever manage to broach the subject with her. The ECT came up briefly in my last conversation with my mother a few months ago. I didn't mention that I remembered the treatment back then. But I said that I might need that kind of treatment again because I'm not coping.

1pq2flo,Friend’s breakdown,"So a few days ago I was hanging out with a longtime friend of mine (24M) because they had recently lost their childhood dog and wanted to be there to support them. We ended up talking for hours at his place and he confessed to having lied about having a brother who passed away a long time ago. He said this is something that he had been wanting to confess to for years now but couldn’t figure out why he would lie about something like this, going on about how he thought it was his way of grieving his childhood but didn’t have a bad childhood growing up. 

I told him he should at least look into therapy to get a deeper look into why he would do such a thing, but it sounds like he’s on the right path at least. I’ve known him since he was 10, and he said he lost his brother at 7. He’s grieved about his loss like an actual person, he said he’s cried about his death for years, and even shown signs of PTSD.

Although I'm not sure if that was even depression or just the fact that school was just this much detrimental to my mental health. By the end of school I felt pretty much like a zombie, neglecting studies, having anxiety attacks and distancing myself from everyone. I even stopped talking to the few other outcast friends I had back then ig.

I know it’s not my job to make everyone feel better but it’s like the ppl I’m around are intent on being frustrated at me or misinterpret everything I say to be a personal attack. It makes me regret talking about what’s up and it makes them go quiet all day. 

I have more I need to talk about soon too and I don’t anticipate it well. I know everyone around me wants a break but there’s too much shit not worked out, and suddenly everybody can only see me as the bearer of bad news. 

I miss being a positive in people’s lives man. I was until we screwed me up. I just want to get my hobbies and my positivity and my life back. I try and say this but everyone goes silent, because they can’t reassure or admit I do any good, because I don’t. 

I feel like it’s my job to be the punching bag, but it’s my fault I don’t wanna put up with how bad others are at communicating. I don’t put up with mistreatment and that makes me a problem. I want to be the person someone can heal with but It doesn’t help when we keep setting me back.

1pq24q1,My dad forced me to take antidepressants (living with my dad situation),"Living with my father was hard, mentally and physically. Visiting my doctor and sitting there while he asks her, ""can you get her checked for bipolar? Or give her some medicine that will make her happy?"" And watching the doctor look at him like he's crazy. Because in reality, he was the bipolar one. Narcissistic, gaslighting, and physiological abuse are the best terms I can use to describe him.

 I love my father of course, but he makes that simple act so difficult to do. For example, in our house every night is fend for yourself dinner, so when I would make my food he would constantly make remarks like ""make sure to do the dishes"" or ""dont make a mess, be sure to clean that up"" and it doesn't seem bad, but he only started saying these things AFTER I was doing them. 
Given, when I was younger and even a year or two ago I hated doing chores. But I decided that I would move in with my mother after graduating high school, and after I made that decision I done all of my chores willingly, without complaint. I would clean my dishes right after use, I would take the garbage out, I would scrub the bathroom. And one time I was cleaning the dishes, I had been scrubbing them really well because my dad was yelling at me and it irritated me, so focusing on them helped distract me. After I finished them, my sister came in my room and told me she had to re do the dishes because Dad said I barely touched them, even though he was watching me clean them. 

Back to my main point, when we would argue (every day without fail, over small inconvenient things) he would be screaming at the top of his lungs and most of the time I kept my composure. He would yell at me to take my medicine and have him watch to make sure I swallowed them. I was forced to take antidepressants and insomnia pills. 

I no longer live with my father, and I also no longer take any pills besides the ones prescribed for my recent surgery. I still get depressed every now and then, as it doesn't magically disappear, but I vowed to myself that I would never touch another antidepressant again.",1,2,2025-12-19 02:32:35,Serious_Peak_4913,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pq24q1/my_dad_forced_me_to_take_antidepressants_living/,mentalhealth,1.0,Content Warning: Addiction / Substance Abuse,0.694,0.06400205058099796,-0.8150008320808411,-1,-0.18650000592422097,0

But like right now, I randomly just remember how lonely I am and feel so fucking depressed. It’s not even that I feel suicidal, I just feel like it’s hard to live like this. I have nobody close to me at all. Not even family.

I can’t even tell anyone this or exactly how I feel because of how disgusting and vunerable it makes me feel. I’m literally referred to cahms and have therapy but I can’t even speak to my therapist, because I hate how gross it feels. Plus, I feel like nobody understands. I can’t stop distancing and isolating from people, even though I crave for someone to understand me. 

I’m so jealous of how people can just have friends so easily. Nobody wants to be close with me. I know this is corny, but I actually feel so empty. It feels like I’m hungry but not for food, like just somebody. I miss having friends so much. I actually have fucking nobody and it hurts so much. Even people that I’m ‘closest’ to, I’m not even close with. They all have people rhey are closer with. I’m just another one of their friends. 

Maybe it’s because I got bullied and had bad experiences with my old friends that I can’t even make friends in my new school. I keep pushing people away, even though some people have actually been nice to me. Its sk fucking dumb that I want a friend but I stop any chances of having one from happening. I’m scared rhat theyll think that I’m weird and get bored and just leave. Or, that they dont even actually like me. I actually wish I was just fucking normal.

1pq1gdc,Real friends are non existent.,"To me a real friend is always there whenever you need them no matter what. If you ring them, you expect them to answer or at least ring you back if they are busy, or a text and a reply obviously not straight way which I totally understand, but a reply the same day and not a day later or never at all. Unfortunately I don’t have that and it’s sad. Sometimes when I’m extremely low which happens often as I have BP and BPD I expect to turn to my friends who I would hope for them to be there for me, but unfortunately I don’t have that either and never have. I have always been the one who’s always made the effort and continued to do it until I finally realised, but I even find myself texting or ringing still, because I always feel alone and just want to talk. For me, I don’t want my son to grow up and say to me why don’t you see your friends or why don’t you have any friends dad, because that will hurt a lot, but at the same time I would happily explain the reasons in why. I mean, I’m not a bad person and I think ever since I told people that I had BD and BPD they kinda distanced themselves from me which seemed coincidental. However I’ve not let that bother me as much, but it’s hard when it all piles on top of you. I’ve never been able to trust anyone either, because of the reasons above, but I still don’t know why nobody bothers with me. I have a child and work a full time job, but no matter what I will make the time for that friend that needs me, because I wouldn’t want them feeling how I felt or feel.

I don't like eating anymore and i've been avoiding socializing aswell. I've been losing weight aswell to the point that i'm underweight now. I lost my parents in early age and I was avoidant in terms of love life. I love someone but when I just started liking her, I just had a few doubts, some of them were my own insecurities and others were just trust issues which could be resolved by just communicating which is bothering me the most. But instead of communicating, I kept passive communication and did not try enough meanwhile she was in love with me this whole time and she kept trying but I just could not notice enough. When I started trying aswell and I committed, it was too late. We've some cultural issues and other restrictions right now which could be resolved only if I had committed earlier because we both were at a better stage at that point. I can't share much details but I am sure about one thing which is that we wouldn't have had these issues if I had committed earlier, now our relationship will most probably have to end in a few months because we won't be able to marry due to those issues. I've realized what we have is so special and unique but too late..She's literally the best girl I've ever met in my life and the kind of personality she has is so rare and compatible with me that and she's literally everything I wanted from my partner. I never thought I'd say this for someone but she's my everything now and I can't live without her and Im sure i'm never gonna move on from her. But I realized all that so late which is why I just keep thinking about past days whenever she's not talking to me. Even if I think about past day for some other reason, I immediately think how I could've changed things if I go back to that time.. I just can't focus on anything these days.

1ppzuld,I Just Feel Numb Now.,"Going into 2025, I was happy, I think… I had traveled to another country for my first real vacation, cut out some bad friends from my life, and lost almost 100 pounds.  I met someone after being single for about 9 months, after a few years in a relationship…

In 2025, the friends I kept have gotten worse. I’m just there to give them money when they're in trouble.  Nothing I say or try to bring up to them about how I’m feeling is heard or listened to.  They actively change the subject if I ask to talk and vent to them.  Something I haven’t done in years, since I was younger and dumber and in worse places than I am now, and they won’t even support me.  In fact, my best friend, whom I haven’t brought up an issue with in a good six or seven years, looked at me when I tried recently and said, “I’m not your therapist, go cry to one.”

Other friends who tell me how much they care are pulling away and vanishing from my life….

My girlfriend hasn’t touched me once in the time we’ve been together, almost a year, and it makes me feel so unwanted and like I’m only their friend.  I love her, but I don’t want to be in a relationship without physical intimacy, and I bring it up; I’ve brought it up in a polite way, talked to her about it.  Nothing changes. I tell her how good she looks, how much I like her body.  She keeps avoiding it, though, or putting her exes on me.  I haven’t been angry or raised my voice to her once, and she constantly apologizes to me for things she hasn’t done wrong.  I try to be patient and understanding, but it’s making me feel like the bad guy.  Add to this that we’re poly, and one of the compromises I offered was that I would start looking for someone to have something consistently with.  Takes care of my needs without pushing her into anything or making her feel rushed.  I started talking to someone (literally just introducing ourselves). I told my partner, to keep the lines of communication open, and even though she agreed to this, she bombarded me with questions about whether this person understands that they will never be my girlfriend.  I feel untrusted because of that, and I feel disrespected because whenever my partner asks for advice, she double-checks whatever I tell her with her parents.  She also avoids the days I hang out with my friends by cancelling on me when we're supposed to meet up.  It makes me feel like shit because I feel like my friends are going to get the idea that she doesn’t like them.

Add to that my friends tell me I’m a great person, I’m fun and friendly.  While my family tells me (twice from two different members this month) that I’m a horrible human being in colorful language.

Oh, and at work, I got a new position and am now in active talks to fire the previous team that I worked with for 10 years…

And I just feel numb… In the first 6 months, I lost another 30 pounds, and I’ve put them all back on in the second half.  I can’t seem to stop eating either.  I don’t find anything fun anymore; I’m looking for excuses not to go out.  I picked up weed this year, which I was personally never interested in before this, and it’s becoming a crutch.  I’m financially drowning, and no one seems to care. I got scolded for suggesting a Secret Santa for my friend group this year, even though we’re all broke.

I don’t even know what I’m looking for by posting this. I will say I’m not at risk of any type of self-harm, and my issues probably seem really small compared to others.

1ppzsab,gaining weight has caused me to be embarrassed to go out,"I (22f) started working full time about a year and a half ago after being a full time college student and part time barista. When I first started college my eating habits were very different. I had lost a substantial amount of weight from an ED and started going to the gym to help me eat and feel happy. 

Since starting full time work I have gained about 20 pounds. I’m so ashamed. I don’t want to see myself naked let alone my boyfriend. I’ve never had the best confidence with my body but I literally just wear sweatpants and sweatshirts to hide myself. I’m not necessarily “fat” but i’m also not skinny. 

I work so hard at the gym and it’s all for not because my depression just makes me eat literally anything I can get my hands on. It’s to a point where I considered Ozempic.

1ppnm4p,3 years on SSRIs and I think they’re actually making me worse rather than better,"Hi. (31F diagnosed with ASD and ADHD)

So i have struggled with anxiety since I was a child. I have trauma in my childhood which has resulted in abandonment issues and extremely low self esteem. My anxiety was never debilitating, I could still get on with my day but it was difficult. Many doctors had wanted me to try SSRIs but I don’t like the idea of taking medication so I refused. 

3 years ago my anxiety got significantly worse. I was having frequent panic attacks and everything got really overwhelming so I started taking Sertraline. I never felt a massive difference on it but I just kept taking it in hopes I would feel better. I also did CBT which helped significantly with the trigger I was struggling with at that time. 

Everything was stable until 2 and a half years ago. I have absolutely no idea what happened but it’s like my mind just suddenly broke. I had a major mental health crisis with scary suicidal thoughts. Ever since that crisis I’ve never felt the same. One thing that really disturbed me is the fact I didn’t struggle with depression before but all of a sudden I was living in this hell of severe depression and anxiety and non stop panic attacks. Every waking moment was this wave of panic going up and down.  I ended up stabilising after about a month but never truly felt like myself again. 

Few more months and I had another major mental health crisis. This time my doctor changed me from sertraline to fluoxetine. Again, I ended up stabilising but never truly felt better. It’s now been 2 and a half years on fluoxetine, everyday is a battle on how I’m going to feel. Food doesn’t taste the same anymore and food used to be a joy for me. I just feel like I’m going through the motions of life but not actually feeling joy and not feeling genuinely happy. Just so disconnected.

The anxiety and panic attacks are the worst part of it all but I think they are fuelled by the depression. I’ve seen multiple therapists and no one has yet been able to help me identify the true cause of all of this. 

Recently I’ve been wondering whether the SSRIs are actually doing more harm than good. The low mood only started after I started on sertraline. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? 

Any personal experience or advice would be very much appreciated. 

I’m just so exhausted. I have 2 children 6&9 and I have such an unimaginable amount of guilt that I feel this way.

1ppqk94,Canceled betterhelp after 6 months and actually feel better about it now,"Everyone talks about betterhelp like it's the solution but honestly it wasn't working for me at all. The therapists kept rotating, I'd finally get comfortable with someone and then they'd be unavailable for weeks, plus the cost was killing me like $280 a month and I wasn't even getting consistent help.

Canceled it last month and felt guilty at first, you know that feeling where you're like """"i should be doing therapy, i'm failing at getting better"""" but then I realized maybe I just needed something different. Not everyone needs the same thing and that's okay I guess.

Tried a few different approaches after that, started journaling more which actually helps sometimes, joined a couple discord servers for people with SA but those felt too chaotic. Then someone mentioned peer support groups and I was skeptical because talking to strangers about anxiety when you have social anxiety feels ironic right?

But I tried it anyway with sharewell and it's been surprisingly helpful, not in a magical cure way more like it's nice talking to people who actually get it without having to explain everything from scratch. The group format is less pressure than one on one somehow, maybe because everyone's there for similar reasons and nobody's judging.

I still have bad days obviously, still avoid phone calls (at least less often), still overthink much social interactions. But I don't feel guilty anymore for not doing traditional therapy and that's honestly a relief. Sometimes different approaches work better.

I worry about whether technology will make me redundant in a few years too. 

I just want a life where I have a middle class job and I don't have to worry too much about competing in the hunger games of the job market.

It makes me feel guilty about potentially having children, bc if I feel like I'm struggling most of the time, this world doesn't seem worth bringing a kid into.

I can use stoicism to get me through my own life. I'm here now, so might as well see what happens in the future. But I'm not sure that rarionale means it's worth bringing another life into existence. 

I also kind of wish sometimes I didn't have a family so that I can choose to leave this Earth on my own terms at some point in the future, probably when age starts to slow me down and the pain catches up.

1ppt69m,"I’ve wanted to be a creator my whole life, so why do I get stuck and feel like a fraud the moment I sit down to work?","I am a 27 yo man, and I have been into art all my life. I was a voracious reader and wrote all through high school. As I grew up, I fell in love with cinema and dreamed of becoming a filmmaker, but I slowly stopped writing. I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression.

I eventually worked in TVC production as an assistant director on 25–30 ads. It was fun, but I was doing manual tasks, not creative work. During COVID, I moved back home and worked as a content writer for five years. Lately, it became unbearable; I felt I was wasting my time. I spent my days daydreaming about creating, but while I wrote for clients, I lost touch with my own creative voice. I didn't pursue filmmaking either, though I always identified as a writer or filmmaker. Recently, I’ve realized my struggles might be linked to ADHD and autism. Because of this, I was completely out of touch with practicing art.

Two months ago, I shifted to freelancing to focus my energy on writing and films. The problem is that now, whenever I sit down to write, my mind goes blank. I have surrounded myself with creative friends who can talk endlessly about their ideas, but I can’t.

I feel ""dumb"" in those moments. I am a thoughtful person who observes life, but I have nothing when I sit down to create. My partner is a painter, and her excitement makes me feel even more blank. It’s unnerving and makes me feel uneasy.

Whenever I see good work, I feel a physical tinge in my heart because I want to create too. I look at creative people and feel sad, wondering how they find ideas. I’ve read that if you can't write, it's because you ""don’t have anything to say,"" but I don’t think that’s true. I feel like a fraud, worrying I’m not creative enough or just interested in the ""glitz.""

I have smoked weed regularly for six years. My wife suggests it might be why I can't process things, and I feel I have disassociated so much I can't draw from my memory. I also think my autism, ADHD, low self-esteem, and childhood trauma play a role. I have a restrained, repressed personality. All these things rush into my head when I’m sitting there unable to create. I feel like I'm being delusional and helpless. Has anyone faced something similar?

yet, when someone has something im envious of or has something i view as a privilege, i don’t feel any sympathy. if someone has a ‘perfect’ life yet feels depressed, i can understand, as in anyone can be depressed, but i feel slightly pissed off and i just cant feel bad. in the end i end up feeling like an evil bitch.

i used to feel for everyone but obviously i was pretty naive so this didn’t do well for me. at some point i tried to shut my empathy off. and ill admit, it was honestly easier caring less (or at least convincing myself i don’t care) about others and ultimately being selfish. but deep down i knew i couldn’t just push my empathy and emotions aside. i realised staying kind after seeing so much evil would be stronger than becoming a bad person because of others.

i just have so much resentment it is insane. i don’t want to be a bad person. my parent makes me feel like one. like a monster. why do i constantly have be my own parents therapist??",1,0,2025-12-19 00:06:25,giant_ballsinurface,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ppyf4n/i_seriously_struggle_to_sympathise_with_certain/,mentalhealth,1.0,Need Support,-0.5997,-0.085823754789272,-0.6769140362739563,-1,-0.5355317690948325,-1

1ppy0k6,2025 has been tough,"I've been through a lot this year and am thankful that I survived. 

6 years ago, I told myself at the age of 30 that I should be driving my own car. After a year, dad was diagnosed with CKD end stage and seen how they struggle for their daily commute for his dialysis session. That reality pushes me to work hard to achieve my goal because I wanted to give my parents a ride going in and out of the hospital and don't need to worry about commuting. 

Unfortunately, I failed. 

At the age of 30, I didn't know that  we'll be starting the year losing my dad. My inspiration. One of the reasons why I work so hard. 

Never did I imagine that at the age 30, i'll be struggling with my finances. I can't even afford to buy myself a pair of shoes, clothes, etc. Even satisfying my cravings has been challenging and ended the year not even buying myself anything.

Because the majority of people in groups are too fast, too judgemental, too reactive, too human lol actually. It feels like a competition for me. Who is gonna say the best anecdote? the best joke?

I didn't want to be complicit. I did not expect this to lead to a full blown affair that was then leaking into my life. I told my friend (her fiancé) today.

1ppvbih,I don't want to wake up in the morning,"Today at a random time during school, I had the urge to just drop everything.
My art, my classes, my friendships… everything.

I thought about removing my character from the story I'm writing with my friend, designing a new character, then muting my friend and not looking at their messages.
I wanted to throw my personal story projects in the trash.
To give up on drawing completely, lock all my art supplies in the cupboard.
To change my Instagram username, or even delete my account.
To cut ties with all my friends, both online and real I imagined it, even wanted it, badly.
I wanted to throw all my connections away.

No, drawing feels pointless now, it doesn’t give me joy like it used to. In fact, I haven’t picked up a pencil in months.
I was doing digital art, but I haven’t drawn anything in a month, and now I want to delete the app, lose all my drawings, let go of my identity as an artist.

There’s a friend of mine who hasn’t drawn in a long time either I wonder if she feels the same way I do. But she has her own life, other priorities; she’s not as empty as I am. That’s why she doesn’t draw. But me? I’m completely empty. My grades aren’t good, neither is my art, my stories, my personality, or my relationships everything is awful, everything is so bad.

It seems like I’ll never draw my stories anyway, so what’s the point of writing them? It’s just a waste of time.
I’m not even going to art school, I won’t be doing the job I want, and even if I did, I wouldn’t make enough money to support myself.  it’s not like I’ll get married and run away from home who would want me anyway?

The story I’m writing with my friend lacks originality, it’s too cliché, and I don’t want to write it anymore because I won’t draw it anyway.
If I remove my character from the story, my friend won’t have a problem.
My friend is online, and we can’t meet up anyway, and even if we did, I’m too ugly I don’t want to be seen like this by her.
She has her own life and lots of friends she can manage without me.

The bus I take ends at a mountainous area near the sea there are lots of high cliffs. Sometimes, instead of pressing the stop button in front of my house, I think about just letting the bus go all the way to those cliffs.

But since then I’ve lost all my spark with anything and everything I loved. I stopped going out, I stopped seeing people, I stopped maintaining myself, I stopped finding things that mattered.

Life has incredible way of letting you down, and I was with a partner who I thought loved me but he didn’t but he was the only kind of support I had but he just reminded me that I’m not a person worth loving, not worth to be seen, not worth to be heard and overtime after isolating and only having him, I think it’s true.

No matter how much friends, family, therapist, psychiatrist say blah blah you’re worth it,  I’m really just not. Everyone says the same thing but in the end of the day it’s just words. Theres no evidence, no support to back their words and everyday I feel pain , I feel the heaviness of being me of feeling and I don’t see my life having purpose 

Really why is it so bad to just go away? It will free me from pain, it will free me from everything.

1ppurcy,"I lost one of the people I love most, and it's my fault...","Hi, how are you?

This happened recently. Yesterday, my best friend texted me: ""This is too much for me. I'm sorry if I don't reply, but I'm not feeling well. I don't want to talk anymore.""


I replied to her message asking what she meant, and she answered: ""I don't want any more contact. It's nothing personal. I need to stop here.""



We talked a little more, but the important thing is that this is completely destroying me. My life has been hell for as long as I can remember: harassment, physical and sexual abuse from an ex-partner, an abusive and violent family, no friends. All of this led me to depression and suicidal and self-harming behaviors from the age of 7. After that, I had two partners. The first sexually abused me and hit me repeatedly. The second was much calmer, but it ended because of differences and my inability to change his behavior.



Now that you have some context about the situation, you'll understand better. My friend and I were close enough to talk about our feelings because we had done so before. In the last month, I had opened up much more, although very cautiously, because I knew she wasn't doing very well emotionally and I didn't want the experiences I shared to affect her. At some point this month, I started telling her about some very traumatic things that had happened to me, just as I experienced them. I was very afraid that she would distance herself or that I would hurt her if I told her all this, but she said it was okay, that we were friends and that friends do that. I insisted that I felt bad for telling her and that I was afraid it would affect her emotional state.


Yesterday, after telling her a little about how I felt, she sent me these messages. I feel so guilty and so devastated, even more than I already did. I feel an emptiness in my heart, an emptiness I've suffered before from losing so many people I loved. I feel consumed by guilt. I hurt a friend I loved so much. I couldn't help her through what she was going through; on the contrary, she ended up helping me.



How can I bear the guilt of feeling so miserable? I've felt alone and miserable for as long as I can remember. How can I bear the guilt of hurting someone so dear?



I miss her presence and I'm afraid she won't come back. I feel like a monster, like someone who doesn't deserve to be loved.


I haven't gotten anyone to reply to my post in other communities. I hope someone can answer this...

For my story I feel like i can't love anyone for me everyone in my life is very special for me I think that if I can something to make my friends happy I will do anything for that

But when everyone is special for me is like no one is really really special for me like I can't truly love someone like a girlfriend I used to love one of my female friend but when started to think it more like admire and protect

Love for me is very very complicate my mind try to find the best of anything including love life I try to find my love life but it just feel off to find it when you have a lot of female-friend it make when you met a new girl in your life I talk to her more like a friend more than interested to her

I saved everything to purchase a business. Although I had no clue what I was doing. I figured it out and life was looking good. Now fast forward to this year. The economy has tanked my industry into nothing. I maybe can last 2 months at this rate before I’ll lose my business and home. It’s hard to even look my wife and child in their eyes anymore. I wake up and feel like I’m failing I go to sleep feeling like I failed. I don’t know how to tell them we mite be homeless starting next year. This stress makes me just want to quit. I was always told just to keep working hard and it’ll payoff. Well it’s not!!  right now I see no path to fixing this. Life can suck I don’t need a lot to be happy I just want a house and food for my family and it just seems like that’s so hard to do now. All this has sparked new stress, anxiety, depression, loss of hope. I’m dealing with it but it’s not an easy task.

And not to mention all the trauma myself and other people endure. Anyway. The other day as Im at work (mortuary transport btw) and im doing my normal routine. Fill out ankle tag. Paper work. Routine, anyway I hand this finished ankle tag to my grandfather and he puts it in his pocket. We get into the home I remind him to put the tag on the decedent. He says okay, but he forgets. We get to the funeral home and theirs people around and he comes up to me and says “where’s that tag at?”  in the most respectful way cause he’s my grandpa “I gave it to you and reminded you before we left the house” he then continues to say “god damn son you fuck up so much it’s like you don’t even work here. You almost offer me nothing” I shrug it off with that hot feeling in my chest. Get my shit done head out to the work van to head home. And he starts in. “I won’t be needing your help with nothing but the heavy work since you don’t know what your doing” push come to shove he tells me I don’t know how to be a man/ that I’m gonna be strung out on meth if I go back to my hometown/ and also said when I said that meth isint a problem in my life like it is his. He says “bullshit your mom’s in jail right now for meth”. His daughter btw. So where on the way home and he says. “I ain’t working with you no more I’ll make sure of it you might as well start looking for another job. So what did I do? I grab the fucking wheel and jerk it as hard as I can in hopes that mother fucker flipped over and we rolled and rolled and I didint give a fuck in that moment what happend.

1ppnyj0,Depression has taken over my life and I don’t know how to get it back,"I’m 32 and I’ve been struggling with deep depression for a long time now. Lately, it feels like my world has shrunk down to just hiding from everyone and everything day after day, and it makes me feel stuck, lost, and hopeless. The longer it goes on, the harder it feels to imagine things being different.I hate admitting this, but drinking has become the only thing that really soothes me. I know it’s not a solution, and I don’t want it to be my life, but right now it feels like the only relief I get from how heavy everything feels.  
  
What makes this even harder is that, on paper, I have reasons to be happy. My boyfriend wants to propose to me and instead of feeling excited, I feel overwhelmed and ashamed that I can’t “get myself together” for this moment in our lives. I care about him deeply, and I feel awful that my depression is standing in the way of fully showing up.  
  
My family tries to be supportive in their own way, but they often suggest going back to God. I’ve tried being more religious before, and I was just as sad then, which makes me feel even more confused and guilty, like I’m failing at something that’s supposed to help. I don’t know how to kick this feeling. I don’t want to keep living like this, trapped and numb and exhausted. I don’t want my life to just pass me by while I hide away. I want to actually have a life and live it. I want to feel like myself again, or at least someone who has hope.  
  
If anyone has been through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing what helped, even if it was just a small first step. I’m trying to hold onto the idea that getting better is possible, even though it feels really far away right now.",2,0,2025-12-18 16:23:28,AdTimely4615,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ppnyj0/depression_has_taken_over_my_life_and_i_dont_know/,mentalhealth,1.0,Need Support,0.318,-0.012750325555203616,-0.8158001899719238,-1,-0.31505016009700265,-1
1ppf0u4,My life ended at 18.,"Many times I think that living isn't for me, I shouldn't still be alive. My life was supposed to end at 18, but I didn't dare to end it.

And here I am, still adrift and heading towards failure because I DIDN'T PLAN TO STILL BE ALIVE by now.

Will all the people who hurt me pay? I see my bullies out there in the city like nothing happened, even the wretch who made my life the most miserable, he greeted me mockingly one day when he was with his...WIFE?? And a CHILD??


Can people hurt others without paying? What kind of world do we live in where those who bully do well and those of us who don't bother anyone do poorly? I don't even know if I'll graduate from my degree program, everything is going wrong. I DIDN'T PLAN TO STILL BE ALIVE BY NOW, DAMN IT!!!


And I just can't stop crying, so many problems to solve, like this damn tension in my back that won't leave me alone and I'm too lazy to get rid of it with the exercises my psychologist gave me. I just SHOULDN'T STILL BE ALIVE. I DIDN'T PLAN THIS, DAMN IT. I'M ON VACATION (I'm an engineer) and a girl rejected me and my mind won't leave me alone and...good heavens, I just shouldn't be alive at this time of year. I can't even eat properly because I haven't had good dental hygiene. I'm having a tooth pulled and ahhhh, one of the few reasons I'm still alive is so I don't give the people who don't like me the satisfaction.

BUT I REALLY HATE BEING ALIVE. I KNEW MY LIFE WOULD END AT 18 (2 YEARS AGO) BUT HERE I AM...WITHOUT DIRECTION... Headed for failure, it's quite likely I'll end up homeless, and my bullies are all successes. I feel trapped more and more, and I just wish I'd taken my dad's gun two years ago and ended it all. I hate myself for not doing it. Everyone tells me I act like a child, but why? Because I didn't plan on still being alive this long. My life was supposed to end at 18, damn it. I get so sad sometimes that I start to not care about pleasing the people who don't like me. But look at me here, just thinking and not acting to change or end it all.

When are the people who hurt me going to pay? When? Because I can't get that guy's cynical smile out of my mind.",9,10,2025-12-18 07:38:31,Shot-Requirement7171,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ppf0u4/my_life_ended_at_18/,mentalhealth,0.92,Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm,-0.996,-0.028618777056277057,-0.8831199407577515,-1,-0.7460837257901312,-1

Separation, death of cat, identity crisis, career choice redefined and much more, I always tried to find a way to get better. I've been followed in psychotherapy, kinesiology, ergotherapy, family doctor, psychiatrist and family support. But even after teyjng so many things, I just feel more and more helpless and hopeless. Gradually, I started having dark thoughts that became harder to resist over time.

This korning I had an aplointment with a psychiatrist and ahe sugfested I go to the ER which I did when I started making plans to pass to action. It took everything to resist, find the will and the energy to get out of the house again and seek help when I am afraid of hospitals.

Now I am in an institute where people.can take care of me. I don't really know what will happen yet, since the meetings and workshops will only start tomorrow in my case.

I reached the end of the rope, but I didn't let go. But I knew I couldn't do it on my own, so I went and asked for help. It is a bit my last option and I hope something will come out of there.

I don't really know why I felt to urge to share, I am not asking for anything.

1pplx42,My life has been on pause since I was 12 years old.,"I used to be a super social kid, I had a bunch of friends and I loved my life. My family moved away from that school and area when I was 11, I made some new friends but the friendships didnt last, and I was bullied ruthlessly for being as short as I was. I went to online school during covid and afterwards I was back in school for maybe a month before my family decided to put me back online. I have always looked young, been short. Since I went online I have been on pause with my whole life, I am 17 now, 5’3, underweight, and I sleep in all day and stay up all night most nights.

I am falling way behind on school and I have no motivation to do anything at all. I get sudden bursts of motivation every once in a while, like right now, but I always end up failing, and going back to old habits. My will power is so weak, I am a late bloomer but I think the way I eat, has made it so even if I was meant to be taller I just didn’t give my body what it needed to get there. My doctor said I was supposed to reach 5’10 at adulthood when I visited about my height 4 years ago.

I have a job, thats about all I have going for me. I work at a nice restaurant and make good money, outside of that though, my life is stopped. I have made no effort to learn to drive despite having my permit. My parents live in separate places and my dad is the only one willing to teach me, but its hard when we both have jobs and I am only at his place 3 times a week at most.

I think I have depression and anxiety, I dealt with all that when I was younger and I think I have just adapted to it, I don’t notice that I have it because its normal to me I think. I have no friends, not even one outside my family.

How the hell do I fix my life when I almost never feel motivated to.

1ppldx4,20M feeling hopeless and I don’t see a future for myself,"20M and I’m currently a third year university student studying game design & development. I honestly have no interest in school whatsoever but I have nothing else in life so I don’t have much of a choice. The reason why I chose this program was because I was never good at core classes in high school (english, math, science, etc) and game design seemed like the only thing that was interesting that I could do + I enjoyed video games a lot growing up.

However with the way things are now I just don’t have any passion to design games as a career I just don’t know what to do at all. The only thing I have going for me is working out at the gym trying to improve my physique and maintaining a healthy diet. I’ve been doing this since September 2024 and I’ve made lots of progress but it’s just a hobby and I don’t even know what I can do with this as a career.

With all this constantly stressing me out I feel like my life is gonna be over after fourth year whether I’m able to graduate or not.

Everyone one of my friends have long term girlfriends and I am consistently hearing how they are thinking of moving in together, do this and that etc and feel like I need this. I find myself constantly wanting female validation on dating apps. Met this one girl spoke for about 3 months but see her ending things soon as she is becoming more distant, online but not responding and just want to ask her like whats going on but do not know how to or if there is nothing them seem weird and overbearing.

I feel like I am lost as the only time I leave the house is for work and have nothing to look forward to and have friends but do not really speak to them much. I work 40hrs a week as a retail manager and although the pay is nice I feel like it is driving me somewhat insane and taking its toll on my mental health. I have been working here for 6 years but only in these last 2/3 has it really set in.

Feel like my life is just revolving round in circles of working coming home, sleeping and continuing the cycle, add feeling lonely into this barely speaking to anyone and worried about my future its only a matter of time until it just gets worse or spirals out of control.

Basically, been married to my spouse 3 yrs, we've been together for 5. They were raised in a religious cult, I am their first relationship. 

  
We had a talk a week or two ago about how they realized they feel the same way about me as they do about their close friends; previously never having had close friendships to compare to. So either they were in love with all of their friends or they arent in love with me, and dont know if they ever really were or if I was just a close friend and they didnt know the difference.  and obvs one is more obvious of a choice. 

  
They love me as a friend and we are staying legally married but I still reflexively say I love you, but no longer hear it back. They work so hard because I'm disabled and leads to them being exhausted all the time to the point I cant really talk to them. They just sound...disinterested and bothered every time im trying to talk to them.

1ppq4e6,Is this a normal mom behavior?,"My mother is a strong personality, she is awfully arrogant sometimes. “I don’t like being stepped down” she says but she almost steps down everyone around her more often than not. She is so conscious of other people around her, she always has a neighbor to hate. Then she is so conscious of the actions of that neighbor that it gets sick sometimes. She thinks their noise for our attention, they want to taint our image as we are two girls living in an apartment . It is so worst that when someone(a male )sings or coughs I have to be worried of how she might perceive it. I hate this feeling. When I confront her that I am tired of this she instantly tells me that i am angry because I want to get rid of her or I am tired of her all together, or sometimes I like that male. Even if I cry due to her actions, she likes to think that I am crying for a whole another reason but am blaming it on her. Whenever I try to tell her that this is sick, she automatically assumes that I want to get rid of her now as she has nothing grand to offer me anymore. The clothes I wear are controlled, I can’t wear tight clothes, can’t laugh loud as it’s not too proper. I don’t smile back to male neighbors, and all in all this just makes me so conscious.

1ppm8x2,I’ve learned to love feeling beautiful as a man,"I love it, I just absolutely love it. I love standing in front of the mirror and appreciating my looks, I may not be the handsomest man on earth. But I love what I see in the mirror. I love my hair, especially my hair. It’s thickness, it’s softness and the way it feels on my head. I’ve been growing it out for the past couple of years and this time with the intention of taking care of it. I love my smile, I love how beautiful I feel, I love how I feel like my body appreciates my kindness and my positive feelings towards it.

In the past, I’ve been very ashamed of how I looked, I’ve been ashamed of my smile, my hair, my face and everything I am. I hated how I’ve been more on the soft side when it came to looks so I did whatever I could to look more “rugged” and “hypermasculine”. Buzz cuts, growing out my beard, having a sense of pride over how tired my face looked. It was toxic.

\>!The reason behind all of this was that (SA TRIGGER) I have been sexually harassed and assaulted by my  male peers in school almost daily throughout the entirety of middle school and highschool. I’ve been made to feel feminine, pathetic and weak, I’ve been groped, touched, bullied, threatened and also seen scenes of harassment around me. It destroyed my sense of self, I hated who I was. It was bad enough that I remembered asking my mother once is it possible for me to make my hair coarse and rough because of how much I hated it.!<

Years later, today, I look much younger than I was before. I’ve learned (or still learning) to appreciate my genetics. Learn that there is no shame is beauty. I’ve been taking care of my hair and taking care of my self, although I still have some issues. I still can not take it if I was looked at in a certain way by another guy. I hate it when a guy calls me beautiful or good looking or anything, it makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable.

1ppg4hu,my sister was diagnosed bipolar and wont accept it,"My sister has had some issues with depression in the past, but last year she moved to a new city and quit her job. She's always been a loner, but obviously she's been much more isolated since then. About two months ago, she started having some concerning symptoms. After several very scary incidents we called a local mental health crisis team who had her committed. She was in the hospital for seven days. We visited her whenever we could.

The hospital diagnosed her bipolar, prescribed an anti-psychotic and set her up with a few appointments, but when she went home she went back to her lifestyle (isolation, no routine, weed, a lot of screentime) and we noticed a regression almost immediately. She keeps trying to cook and leaving the burner on. She spent $5000 in one day. She's not making any sense when she speaks.

We voiced our concern, but at this point she's furious. She thinks we're ruining her life, that we have munchausen's by proxy, that we're colluding with her doctors to keep her locked up. We're reading everything we can about bipolar disorder (it makes sense to us, but we're not experts), and we know not to argue with her, to listen to her, to try to tell her we love her and she can trust us. We don't want to drive her away. We know we're all she has right now.

I know no one here can offer medical advice, but I figure with a community this big, hopefully there's someone out there with a story like ours. Someone who can give us some hope right now, while we're scared out of our minds. Thank you for any advice.

TL;DR My sister is bipolar but thinks she's fine, but we're scared for her safety.

1ppps6b,what should i do？（dont worry about my feelings，just wanna find a practical way forward，if there has）,"Sorry for English is not my first language. The following content was translated by tool. And i apologize for my story being so long，it‘s way too long.

•	⁠[Background] - 

The thing is, I was born into a very poor family (yes, a very typical start). My dad is an alcoholic, and my parents often argued about money from when I was young. My dad has a strange and irritable temper. When I was little, if their arguments got intense, they would both grab knives, and at that time, I would run to the neighbors for help. When I was four or five years old, my mom would often have my dad drop me off at my grandma's house because of work (during this period, I was constantly being sent back and forth, and I remember every time my dad drove, I felt severe fear in my heart, to the extent of a serious traumatic stress response. At grandma's house, there were grandma, aunt, uncle, and aunt's son. I wasn't happy at grandma's house, but I don't want to describe these in detail, because the memories there also carry a strange feeling. I think this strange feeling might come from deep trauma, but my brain has sealed it away, so I don't know what exactly happened. I only remember that grandma and them abused me a lot, I hated it there, but they never hit me). This experience had some influence on my personality (but it didn't cause mental illness). Later, I returned home to live with my parents, and then I started elementary school. Around third grade in elementary school, my mom took me and left my father, but my father kept harassing my mother, until later when my mother's friends brought many men over, which intimidated him and made him stop harassing us. After moving out, we relied on my mom working as a nanny or waitress to pay for rent and food.

Life was not affluent. From starting elementary school, I studied very hard because I knew this was the only way for me to change my fate. I thought as long as I studied well, when I grow up, I could find a good job, at least so my mother wouldn't worry about where to live or what to eat every day. My wish was to become middle class, have a decent job, buy a house for my mom, so she wouldn't have to work as a nanny anymore, we wouldn't have to move around, wouldn't worry about food, could live peacefully, and even enjoy some life. Everything went smoothly; I was very smart from a young age, with good grades, always in the top few. And I looked okay (but not the best-looking), I was a prominent figure. Although I came from the worst elementary school in the whole city, through hard work, I step by step got into better junior high and high school, always staying first. Until junior high graduation.

*** — [Incident] — 

Around my third year of junior high (note in advance: our school system is three years junior high and three years high school, junior high and high school are not in the same school, which school you go to depends on your exam scores), l felt my jaw was very uncomfortable, my left and right face asymmetrical (actually from junior high I had this feeling, but not obvious), my bite and bones were awkward, so during the summer from third year junior high to first year high school, I called my parents (I'm from a single-parent family) to see a dentist.",1,4,2025-12-18 18:08:07,avocado_beer,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ppps6b/what_should_i_dodont_worry_about_my_feelingsjust/,mentalhealth,0.99,Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm,-0.1436,0.05613222168777724,-0.7848117351531982,1,-0.42425942323904364,-1

Do you feel like you’re actually happy in life most of the time — or does it feel more like a mix of stress, responsibility, and problem-solving, with good moments sprinkled in?

From the outside, it often looks like people have things together, but I can’t tell how much of that is real contentment versus just coping, adapting, or pushing through. I’m not asking in a dramatic way — more in a realistic, human way.

Would love to hear how others think about happiness:
• Is it something you consistently feel?
• Or more something you touch occasionally?
• Or does it come and go depending on the season of life?

Genuinely curious how people define this for themselves.",2,1,2025-12-18 14:13:39,careeradvice35,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pplzmb/are_people_actually_happy_or_is_everyone_just/,mentalhealth,1.0,Question,0.9783,0.2491666666666667,0.0,-1,0.3433233333333333,1

1pplvce,"What questions do you think were helpful, or do you wish you had been asked sooner, when it comes to having gotten your “correct” diagnoses?","Last August, I 30M, finally saw I psychiatrist I was probably long overdue for and came out with a depression diagnoses and prescription, which was great. At the same time, I had been sent out for a neuropsych eval to see about any autism or adhd. The results were broken down for me as: “if we were to place autism/adhd on a spectrum from 0-100, and we said from 0-94 is a no and 96-100 is a yes, then you came in right in the line at 95” (This was for both, individually). 

Long story short I came away with nothing helpful, largely because it seemed like the only question I was really asked was “why did you think you have XYZ” rather than any clarifying questions meant to explore anything. I get that they can’t ask leading questions but it felt like there was very little actual questioning about my past and I was sort of expected to have everything ready to go myself, which I thought was bizarre. 

Anyways, I’ve since requested a reevaluation, but this time I intended on coming more prepared. The problem I ran into though, is that every single “hey you could have XYZ” thing I see feels like it fits me, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid by not doing any reading before my initial evaluation. 

So my question is, when you were trying to determine what did or didn’t seem like a qualifying event, what questions did you ask yourself, or were you asked, that you feel helped you articulate what you felt was an issue. 

To clarify, I am not asking for you to attempt to diagnose me, I am asking for help in finding a process to identify which experiences are relevant by myself (and probably my psychiatrist) ",2,0,2025-12-18 14:05:24,Ken-as-fuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pplvce/what_questions_do_you_think_were_helpful_or_do/,mentalhealth,1.0,Question,0.8201,0.08038607804232804,0.6612019538879395,-1,0.5927081925524353,1
1pppgbu,Stress has taken away my personality,"I used to be fun, energetic, and quick witted. But life has been beating me down pretty hard the last few years. I’ve developed a health condition that limits what I can do, and I haven’t been able to find a job that I can do with my health issues, so I’ve been stuck with gig apps which have left barely keeping my head above the water.

I think the medical stress, financial stress, and overall stress about everything in the world have dimmed me. And idk how to get myself back.

It’s like I have brain fog all the time. I used to be able to charm people just by being myself. I was very funny and intuitive with people’s needs. But now I can’t even tell when someone is being serious or just telling a dry joke. I can’t read people, and when I try to engage in conversation with new people it just falls flat every time. I feel like half a person and idk how to get back the parts of myself that I loved the most.

And the horrible part is there’s nothing I can do to take the stress away. They’re not problems I can fix. I can’t get a better job or fix my health. So I’m just stuck in this fuck where everything keeps compounding and there’s no escape until someday when my body decides to work properly again.

1pplq9t,"The ""Poor Me"" Trap: When Your Brain gets Bored and Invents Problems","**Yesterday, my mother-in-law asked to share my car for the day, and my brain immediately tried to convince me she was sabotaging my life.**



As humans, we have a strange tendency to self-victimize. I used to think—nope, that’s not me. I’m practical. I work on my growth. I’m no victim. **But I’ve realized: I am.**



When life is smooth and I’m happy, the slightest inconvenience can trigger a massive internal story.Suddenly, the ""mind monkey"" starts whispering:



* *""I’m such a poor soul.""*
* *""She’s doing this on purpose so I can’t make plans.""*
* *""She only cares about her son; she doesn’t see how I have to bend my whole life for her.""*

**Poor me, right?**

It sounds ridiculous when I type it out, but in the moment, I believe every word. Our brains are built to solve problems, but when there aren’t any real ones, the brain gets bored. So, it fabricates a ""problem"" just to have something to do.

We miss how trivial the issue actually is. We take the thought seriously, it ruins our mood, and it spoils our perspective toward people who—in reality—are absolute sweethearts.



**So, how do we switch off the brain at times like this?** How can we practice discernment between real and unreal problems? Our brains are incredibly influential and tell very compelling stories, but they aren't 100% honest.



I am halfway there because I’ve finally identified the pattern. But I’m still learning how to train the mind to stop making up deluded stories.



**I’d love to hear from you:**

* What are some ways you practice discernment when your brain starts talking to you?
* How do you know when to listen and when to just let the ""mind monkey"" chatter pass?",2,0,2025-12-18 13:55:33,Responsible-Rule5345,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pplq9t/the_poor_me_trap_when_your_brain_gets_bored_and/,mentalhealth,1.0,Question,-0.7702,0.10691849816849817,-0.7457367777824402,-1,-0.5825446892575205,-1

1ppp70x,How do you find chosen family as an adult who values depth and reciprocity?,"I’m posting this from a place of genuine exhaustion, not bitterness.

I’m someone who values depth, consistency, humor, and real reciprocity in relationships. I don’t need constant intensity, but I do need people who show up, take responsibility for their lives, and care about shared effort over time.

I’ve been told I’m “too sensitive” more times than I can count. What that usually means is that I notice patterns, emotional undercurrents, and misalignment — and I don’t want to pretend they don’t exist.

I’m tired of dynamics where I’m doing the emotional labor, holding space for venting that never turns into change, or being close only when it’s convenient for the other person. I’m not looking to fix anyone or be fixed — I just want mutual presence and growth.

I’d love to hear from people who’ve found chosen family later in life:
– How did you find people who value depth without codependence?
– How did you learn to screen for reciprocity early on?
– Where did you meet people who actually want to “do life” together in a healthy way?

I’m not interested in being told to “care less” or “lower my expectations.” I’m more interested in learning how to protect my energy while staying open to the right people.

If you’ve been here and found your people, I’d really appreciate hearing how.

1pplkpo,help forgetting a nightmare,"hey guys! i need help— i saw a short horror skit a few months ago and it’s been haunting me since. 

Specifically, the video involved a horror story where a woman in the bathroom is screaming “that’s not me!!” at her own reflection in the mirror,  and becomes increasingly panicked. Her friend, out of concern, leaves the bathroom to grab her phone and call someone, but when that friend returns the woman is “normal” again,, but smiling very creepily towards the camera. She then speaks rather mechanically and that’s how the skit ends.

The actress is really talented,  but erm, maybe too talented. I can still hear the way she screamed— I saw this video on tiktok so I didn’t think much of it and saw the whole thing through. 

That proved to be a big mistake, since now it’s causing me to be irrationally afraid of mirrors!!

Every time i go to wash my hands, or wash my face, I just see the video replay and think “that’s not me, that’s not me!” and I can’t bear to face myself anymore.

How do I overcome this?! It’s actually super scary and I don’t want to experience psychosis or anything because of it… I’m already a bit of a paranoid person to begin with :(

1ppjape,Why do I stay in relationships I know are toxic — and why do I become someone I don’t recognize when they try to leave?,"I’m writing this anonymously because I’m deeply ashamed and confused by my own behavior, and I need honest perspectives.

I am an adult — not a teenager — and yet I repeatedly find myself staying in relationships that I know are toxic.

Logically, I can see it clearly:

They disrespect me

They threaten me

They are emotionally cruel

They make me anxious, small, and unstable

I know I should be the one walking away.

But the moment they pull away or threaten to leave, something in me completely breaks.

I become intensely anxious — almost panicked — at the thought of them leaving. Even when I know they’re bad for me, my body reacts like abandonment equals danger. I beg, I plead, I try to explain myself again and again, hoping they’ll finally understand or stay.

When they block me, I spiral.

I create new accounts just to reach out.

I tell myself “this will be the last time.”

I just want closure, reassurance, or to feel human again.

From the outside, I know how this looks.

I know it crosses boundaries.

I know it turns me into the person I never wanted to be.

They then threaten police complaints.

They tell me I’m harassing them.

They say I’ve lost my dignity.

And honestly? That part destroys me the most — because I never wanted to hurt anyone. I just couldn’t tolerate the anxiety of being abandoned.

What scares me is this:

I can clearly identify toxic behavior in others, but I still stay.

And when I stay too long, I become toxic in response.

It feels like I turn into the villain of my own story.

I’m not trying to justify my actions. I take responsibility for them.

But I’m trying to understand:

Why does my fear of abandonment override my self-respect?

Why does my nervous system react so violently to being left?

Why does knowing something is toxic not stop me from clinging to it?

How do adults break this cycle before it destroys them?

I’m starting therapy and going no-contact, but the shame is heavy.

I want to change — not just behavior, but the panic underneath it.

If anyone has experienced something similar, or understands this from a psychological perspective, I would really appreciate hearing from you.

Please be honest, but kind.",3,3,2025-12-18 11:22:21,StudioInteresting409,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ppjape/why_do_i_stay_in_relationships_i_know_are_toxic/,mentalhealth,1.0,Content Warning: Addiction / Substance Abuse,-0.9949,0.06019283746556474,-0.848615825176239,-1,-0.7107393450950066,-1

1ppoor1,I can no longer find my mental clarity / personal problems,"I just finished a long academic journey and it hasn’t been exactly inspiring. I started out happy, but then I found university to be a harsh, competitive environment with limited career opportunities. While I initially wanted to pursue a PhD, I later decided against it because it seemed like an endless state of precariousness. I went through the thesis period (which lasted almost two years) with severe anxiety crises and suicidal thoughts because my family is in academia, and they expect me to have a great career like theirs. I’d open my laptop and start crying; it always felt like I was writing a terrible thesis, and I lost all confidence in myself. After these two years, I managed to graduate, and I was even offered to publish my thesis, but I’m still not happy because it means I’ll have to go back to reading those things I swore I would never look at again.

Once this chapter ended and I started working (I recently got a stable job), I thought things would get better, but the truth is I feel like I’m wasting myself in a job I’m overqualified for, which doesn’t allow me to fulfill my cultural aspirations. That’s why I’ve started reconsidering the possibility of doing a PhD, which makes me anxious and triggers those same feelings of dread I suffered from earlier.

Additionally, my boyfriend (27) is about to start a PhD abroad, which makes me feel jealous, even though I want to be happy for him. He’s had everything “easy” in university: a professor who follows him, projects tailored specifically for him, recommendations, and things just “handed” to him without him having to make any effort. Despite the fact that I speak four languages and he speaks only two, he managed to go abroad, unlike me. He has never worked, while I’ve bent over backwards to work, study, and learn languages in the hope of finding a job worthy of me.

All of this makes me feel bad because I love him so much, but my work anxieties are turning the relationship, from my point of view, into a nightmare. Especially because it seems like he, having had such a much easier life than mine, doesn’t really understand what it’s been like for me to live this situation, nor does he realize that he is, in fact, a true exception and that, normally, things are not that easy for anyone.

I’ve spent months sending applications for anything, without any real opportunity. Yet, I’ve struggled so much with the job search experience that the thought of going back to studying, or even just reading an article, makes me feel terrible. Every time I open my computer to correct drafts  I get anxious, start scrolling through social media for hours

A few years ago, in addition to using my phone much less, I had a very high concentration threshold when studying, and I always achieved excellent results. Now,  I can no longer find that clarity I once had. I’m starting to study my fifth language, and I’m struggling much more than with the others. All concentration-related activities have become exhausting, and I really don’t know how to get out of it. It feels like I no longer have the mental ability to handle PhD applications or any job that requires focus. A few years ago, I had a very severe case of COVID, and I thought I might have developed brain fog, but I’m not sure. Given the whole situation, I’m starting to think I might be suffering from some form of depression.

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2367,177,2019-10-29 20:22:02,SQLwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,depression,1.0,,0.9973,0.13233957219251336,-0.5602427124977112,-1,0.045536558189647025,0

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your intentions.  Neither is ever acceptable here in any form.  

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. **Feelings that can be explained by person's circumstances are perfectly healthy no matter how painful they are. A depressive** ***disorder*** **only exists when someone's mood is out of synch with what's going on for them.** The ""what is depression"" wiki linked above has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but do NOT belong here.",7,48,2025-11-05 04:23:54,SQLwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oom3z4/checkin_post_with_essential_information_about_our/,depression,0.89,,0.8942,-0.017492492492492483,0.0,-1,0.2647615015015015,1
1pq728k,My confession before suicide,"Today I feel terribly bad; lately I've felt like shit.


When I was 9, a friend of my mother sexually abused me, and the same thing happened when I was 10 (something I haven't told anyone). Since then, all my memories are miserable, and this year was the worst. My school friends, whom I've known for two years, suddenly stopped talking to me. My best friend died in an accident, and my grandparents also passed away. I'm alone. Now I have no one to talk to, and I feel completely empty. My parents don't listen to me, and I'm afraid to talk to my brother.


Now it's harder to sleep every night, food tastes like nothing, and I'm crying for no reason...

Tonight I'm home alone, the box cutter in front of me looks more and more tempting. It hurts that the first person to find my body will be my brother, because my mother is away on a business trip and won't be back for a few weeks, and besides, my relationship with her isn't the best. I can't stop thinking about my brother and how awful he must feel. He and I used to be best friends; over time we drifted apart emotionally, but I still care about him a lot.
I wrote several letters, one for my mother, another for my brother... and one for my ex-partner. It sounds strange, but I feel like he was the only one who truly understood me, the only one who genuinely tried to help me. I think he must feel terrible. He tried to help me and make me feel better, and I'm going to kill myself...

Anyway, I just wanted to talk about my feelings one last time.

1pq3c4l,I think i'm fucked please read this,"     Hey, I’m posting this to find people who share the same problem I’m going through, because I didn’t find anyone IRL who understands it and I’m running out of solutions to cope with this.

I don’t have any life goals, interests, hobbies, or passions. If I had unlimited money and could do whatever I want in life, I would do absolutely nothing except eat and sleep so I wouldn’t die. I’m desperately looking for a passion or something that could consume me, something I would truly love from the bottom of my heart. Something I could throw myself into for the rest of my life. Even if it’s several small things, even if it’s not socially well regarded or judged useless — just something.
For the last four years, I’ve been actively chasing after such a thing, and I’m stuck in the same loop, which consists of being overly hyped about something for two weeks (at best), then losing all interest the day after and falling again into the void where I have fucking nothing to do and where sleeping is more interesting (because I can dream or make time pass faster) than being awake in this nightmare.

I know I’m probably in a state where my brain feels dead, so I have little chance of escaping this loop, but I really feel like I’ve tried everything to get out. I forced myself to do things I wasn’t interested in, and nothing changed (except a new hatred for the things I tried). I tried therapy, but I faced a clueless person who didn’t understand my issue, so it didn’t go far.

I truly think that a solution doesn’t exist, but I’m making this post to find someone who can relate to this and tell me their story. Please do not tell me generic things like “try to go out,” “you need someone to talk to,” or “try another therapist.” None of that shit worked for me.

If you relate to my story, please tell me yours. I’m very interested, especially if you succeeded in getting out of this.

1pqembc,I don't think I have a future,"I am a female that is sixteen years of age right now, turning seventeen soon. It feels like because of the horrible language barrier between me and my own mothers tongue, I wasn't able to stick some of that common or basic knowledge taught to me back in primary school, now I walk along the hallways like an idiot because there are some things I genuinely don't know about that any average person would know of.

I'm also a person with many hopes and dreams, and I believe I have the potential. I just don't know where to start, I feel like a mess. Everytime I tell myself to do something I will procastinate until the project's final hours and begin to cry on end. When I'm not in the mood to deal with my own emotions, I will take the blade I hide in my fantasy storybook's pages and cut myself again. To top it off, I'm a very awkward person. It's not that I'm antisocial and refuses to make new friends, but I didn't talk to people for so long that when I do I genuinely do not know how to speak. People think I'm weird, nobody has told me this but I know people feel this way about me.

I hate going to school every day and seeing people walk with their friends. I have friends, too, but it doesn't feel like I'm as close to them. Everybody has something or someone to motivate them, it's no wonder everybody smiles even after a bad grade. It's to the point I'm convinced god is aiming at me or trying to bring the worst out of me. I know he isn't, I know the universe has granted me multiple chances to bring the best out of myself. I don't know why I keep rejecting, I don't understand just what is making me feel this horrible and what makes me refuse to do anything worthy.

I'm just so tired. I want a friend to talk to. I don't want to cut myself anymore, I don't want to masturbate every night, I don't want to think about a different suicide plan every day. I don't want to think about hiring an assassin to kill me. I don't want to not study anymore. I'm so scared for what will happen to me, I don't know what to do. If I could just perform well in my exams I would not care about the little close friends I have or the amount of people I talk to.

1pq5ioc,I am being consumed by lust and I hate myself for it,"by lust i dont mean im incredibly horny, I am, but thats not the main problem. its I feel that I'm hungry for love, attention, and social status. atp that I'm being selfish. All my life I had friends but never a best friend. Being 20 never experienced anything with the opposite gender. I have inferiority complex. During summer I finally left my lonely box and tried to socialize with people online. it went well at first I met different kinds of ppl and it kind of gave me confidence which what I'm lacking heavily in the past but things turn around when someone started to fall for me. Tbh I like her but not at the romantic level but it felt so new to me so I accepted it. I flirt with her so well but deep inside its not completely genuine. Then I met another girl she turns out she likes me too so I flirted with her too even tho I have mixed feelings for her but i still like her, Then another one came I did the same. I even go as far as reassuring them that the others are just friends telling them theyre the only one in my life even tho its not the case. I make them feel like theyre special. during early stages I often flirt with them for fun but it gets to a point where they actually fall inlove with me and I just cant reject it, its like I dont want it to end, I dont want them to distance themselves, I dont wanna lose them. So I always end up doing what they want, and going too far with them atp I cant get out

Then now theres a new girl thats been getting into the friend group and I feel frustrated and down when it feels like she likes my friend more than me. But I can't help myself even if I tell myself ""I dont care"", ""I dont even know her much"", ""I'm just making friends"", ask myself why?. I dont visibly show this side of me. I dont push my friend away or anything. I'm just acting normal, I'm not pushing things to get close with her. I can hide it very well but it hurts me.

I know I'm an asshole I dont deserve the love of the other girls that theyre giving me. Its not that theyre lacking, theyre giving me all that they can and most of what I ask for. they make me smile. I like them ofc but since theyre not the only one i'd say not at such scale even I dont believe myself anymore for a long time now. But why do I keep flirting with almost everyone I get close to.

I'm being tolerated too much for my actions. Send me hate comments it might make me feel better as its definitely what I deserve. I deserve to get beaten up, slapped, get heart broken. I dont wanna talk to anyone anymore, I wanna go back to my box at the same time I dont want to.

I have a good friend, we met two years ago but we live no where near each other and I love her. I love her so dearly but I'm lost on what to do. She's so brilliant to me, and I appreciate her so incredibly much but she's severely depressed. I've been in a similar position albeit not identical , and even though it's a shared diagnosis depression presents itself so differently in people and what symptoms they show I tried to use what helped me but I recognized it wasn't beneficial. I want to help her though. I want to be there for her as much as possible and I want her to take care of herself and her health. So I guess I'm asking what support could I offer?

1pqh7t7,Advice needed: Considering going to an inpatient treatment center for depression,"Hello. This is my first post here so I apologize if there are any issues. I'll give some background on me so you guys can better understand my situation.

I am 23, female, live in the US, and I have severe depression and my psychiatrist thinks that I may have Bipolar 1. I was hospitalized in 2023 for suicidal ideation and was in the hospital for one week. And then I did 2 weeks of partial hospitalization therapy. 

This depression has caused a lot of issues in my life. Today I was fighting with my mom over my childhood issues. When I was in my teens I got very depressed for around a year. I refused to ever clean my room so I had trash bags piled up around my bed. I never did my laundry and I rarely showered or brushed my teeth. I failed a class and got a D- in another class, which I had never done up until that point, and I refused to participate in any clubs or outside activities. So basically everyday after school I would come home and go straight to sleep. My room got so bad that my parents took my door off of my room. I think I was also in psychosis for parts of that year because I did some weird stuff. I thought God was sending me signs through angel numbers and one time I thought someone was trying to kill me so I barricaded the doors with chairs. I wont go into everything I did but I think I was having some kind of mental breakdown at the time. 

The argument my mom and I had was over that year. I was blaming her for not getting me help for that year because I thought she should have seen the signs. My mom was saying that she thought I was just being a moody teenager. I should say that my mom did end up taking me to a therapist my junior year, so eventually she did do something. My mom also made the point while we were arguing that she had never known anyone who needed to be hospitalized for depression and that she had not even considered that a possibility. She said that it was not normal that I needed to do that. All I remember is being depressed that whole year, but my mom said there were times when I was happy and that I am having false memories. I honestly don't know if I was actually happy back then or not. For some reason it is like my memories are corrupted. 

We also argued about my reaction to my friends' deaths. When I was 12, a friend of mine died of brain cancer and I took it really bad. I still bring it up today, and my mom says that I need to let that go. That friend and I were not super close, I think we only hung out a few times, but her family ended up giving me some of her stuff cause they said I was a good friend. About six months ago, a friend of mine killed herself. I had known this friend since childhood, and we had drifted apart, but within the last year we reconnected and were hanging out occasionally since we went to different universities. I was sad about her death but my mom said since we weren't super close I should be over it by now. And I don't know if she is right. Am I holding onto this for no reason?

Every few weeks I tend to spiral and have a breakdown where I think about killing myself and end up lashing out at the ones I love. I say mean things and I blame them for all of my problems. I usually text them mean things. I think im useless and a failure and that I would be better off dead. Recently I got fired from my job, and have had trouble finding another job. I have a bachelor's degree, but the job market is bad. My mom said that if my depression was affecting me this much that maybe I would have to find an easy job and go live the rest of my life in public housing. I do not want to do that. She also said that if I am this depressed I should think about going to an inpatient treatment center to get the help I need. I cannot keep living in this depression. I think that if I keep being this depressed I am going to end up killing myself someday. So, I am considering finding an inpatient treatment center. Here are my questions for you guys:

1. Do you think an inpatient treatment center would help? I have heard some bad things so I am a bit nervous.

2. If you have been to an inpatient treatment center, what was it like? Any advice for getting along day to day?

3. Do you guys have any recommendations for inpatient mental health treatment centers in the US? I am having trouble finding them. I would like one that is solely about mental health, as I have no substance abuse issues. I have good insurance and can pay up to $7,000 out of pocket if needed, so im not too worried about the price. i do not want to be hospitalized in an actual hospital ward again. So please, no actual hospitals.

4. Am I holding onto the past too much? I feel like I am stuck in a loop and cant get out.

Thank you guys for reading all this.

1ppx9po,Killing my Twin was a big Catalyst to my Mental Health Struggles,"When I was probably about 9 years old, my mum had told me about her pregnancies. She told me that she falls pregnant extremely easily but had ovary issues. This caused miscarriage. She’s been pregnant about 15 times maybe more in her life most didn’t make it past 3 weeks. She only had me and my sister. The later miscarriages were the ones just before me and my sister. Dr said it was kinda like her body getting ready to have a baby by (morbid I know) practising by developing and miscarrying a foetus first.

But she told me when she had me, she had another miscarriage at about 10 weeks and when she was still feeling okay and went to Dr a week later she was still pregnant and it was me. She had vanishing twin syndrome but in its later stage so was a miscarriage not an absorption like most.

So basically, I killed my twin - more common that people realise I know, but have thought for a while that not having my twin is even just a small part of my severe mental illness.

I have severe depression, GAD, ADHD and Autism and also not diagnosed but heavily suspect Borderline Personality Disorder. Especially fearing abandonment. And this is certainly a pretty obvious kicker!

I pretty much killed them I know it’s just Darwinian but like, a twin is the closest human connection in the world they are literally you, they’re a soulmate. Vanishing twin is most common in identical twins too so that’s even worse. I killed the only person who would ever truly understand me. I was abandoned literally before birth, and it was kinda my fault!

I’ve been suicidal since the age of 7. A good part of that is racked with survivors guilt, hating my life wishing my twin could have lived instead I could have just been the dead pile of cells instead. I would never have experienced misery.",50,24,2025-12-18 23:21:55,PreparationVisual586,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppx9po/killing_my_twin_was_a_big_catalyst_to_my_mental/,depression,0.68,,-0.9936,0.12175925925925925,-0.49808305501937866,-1,-0.5227696756578375,-1

1pqeybf,riptide of tears revised,"Riptide of Tears

Catch me in the riptide of tears,
where grief doesn’t scream—
it suffocates.
I am dragged, not taken,
pulled under by something
that knows my name.

The air fills my lungs
the way guilt fills a room—
uninvited, inescapable.
My chest tightens until breathing
feels like a mistake,
and every sound I make
is proof I’m still here
when I shouldn’t be.

Should I stop resisting?
The water doesn’t ask questions.
It doesn’t need reasons.
Whatever happens, happens—
isn’t that what life has taught me?
That pain arrives regardless,
and meaning is something we pretend
to survive it.

Do I feel too much,
or am I simply defective?
There’s no witness inside my head
to testify otherwise.
Maybe it’s better not knowing
what people really think—
how easily affection curdles,
how quickly love turns observational,
conditional, temporary.

The thought of being unlovable
is a slow infection.
Not dramatic—
just persistent.
I crave connection like oxygen,
but I don’t know how to hold it
without choking.
I don’t know how to trust
without bracing for impact.
They will hurt me.
They always do.
Hope is just the pause
before it happens.

Should I stay,
or erase myself quietly?
Loneliness hollows me out,
but closeness dismantles me—
abandonment looping like a pulse,
jealousy sharpening every silence,
digging through memories, messages, tone,
until I uncover enough damage
to justify the ache.

Some things rot when exposed.
Depression isn’t sadness—
it’s surplus.
Being too much
and never enough.
Nothing holds weight.
Everything erodes.
Helplessness stops feeling temporary
and starts feeling anatomical.

Was I ever good?
Or just convenient?
Will I ever exist
without needing proof?

Distrust and abuse don’t disappear—
they rewire.
They teach love as threat,
safety as borrowed time.
They leave instincts that sabotage joy
before it has the chance
to become real.

Am I selfish?
Yes.
And still I would empty myself—
skin, spine, savings—
just to keep someone from leaving.
I would call it love
and mean it.

So I sit—
lungs leaking water,
mouth tasting salt and iron,
tears indistinguishable
from the damage.
My body knows surrender
better than relief.

I think of the child I was—
how unprepared she was
for endurance.
If she knew what waited for her—
the loving and losing,
the becoming someone
others would misunderstand,
resent, fear—
would she forgive me
for continuing anyway?

The riptide tightens.
I stop fighting—not because I want to vanish,
but because resistance
requires hope,
and hope feels irresponsible.

If I survive,
it won’t be because I was saved.
It will be because the current
got bored of me.

I am not peaceful.
I am not healed.
I am a riptide of tears—
still here,
out of spite,
out of habit,
out of breath.

1pqgmzm,18M I feel stuck watching life pass by,"I’m 18 and this is hard to write, but I don’t really have anyone else to talk to.

I’ve been introverted for as long as I can remember. On top of that, I struggle with social anxiety. Simple things—starting a conversation, speaking in groups, even asking doubts—feel overwhelming. My mind goes blank, my body panics, and afterwards I replay everything in my head for hours.

Because of this, I don’t really have friends. Not close ones, not people I can open up to. Most days I feel like I exist on the sidelines of everyone else’s life.

I’ve also never had a partner. No relationship, no one who has ever been romantically interested in me. Watching people my age form connections so easily makes me feel left behind, like I missed some important instruction everyone else got.

At home, things aren’t abusive, but they’re emotionally empty. I’m provided for, but I don’t feel understood. There’s no one I can sit with and say, “I’m not okay,” without feeling dismissed or awkward. So I keep everything inside, and it keeps piling up.

Lately, I feel a constant sense of loneliness and sadness. I try to focus on studies and self-improvement, but depression and anxiety drain my energy. Some days I manage to push through, other days even getting started feels impossible. It’s not laziness—it’s mental exhaustion.

What hurts the most is feeling invisible. Like I’m trying my best, but no one really sees me. I don’t want attention or sympathy—I just want connection. I want to feel like I matter to someone.

i don’t know why, but it made me really sad. it’s the realisation that id never be able to say those words with proper meaning. 

i’ve been thinking this for awhile, but i really don’t have anything to live for. no purpose in life, no role in existence. 
nobody really loves me, i constantly feel like the world has forgotten me - and maybe rightfully so; i’m not a good person by any means, so i don’t really deserve to experience the joys and fulfillness of life.

i’m awfully lonely, i really am. i never asked to be this way, i want to hugged, i want to be told lovingly that everything is going to be alright.

1pqgjcz,Disappointing results from pharmaceutical treatments and what happens if you're resistant to standard psychiatric care,"Don't really know where to start with this so I'll try to go as far back as it's useful to tell this story. Ever since I can remember I have always carried a deep sense of sadness and inadequacy in me. Even in the first years of elementary school I remember having already the feeling that, for whatever reason, good things were not meant to happen to me. Things then escalated and worsened significantly during middle schools and high school, though in this latter part I was trying my best to live fully and not overtly trying to seclude myself. I started seeing a psychologist at around 16, although this first experience, i think, wasn't all that useful to me. From the age of 17 to about 20-21 I was in therapy with this new psychologist, with whom I saw some significant improvement (mainly with issues of overthinking and social anxiety). From 22-24 I had a third therapist, who was recommended to me by my second therapist. At 23 I went to a psychiatrist for the first time and got a first vague diagnosis of depression and anxiety, which was later identified to be BPD. To cut a very long story short, I was in therapy with this guy for about a year, with progressively higher dosages of Zoloft at first, then Lyrica and ultimately Benzodiazepine too. At the end of this year I realised I wasn't seeing any improvements anymore, and it could be also easily argued that I was doing worse than when I started with him. About 8-10 months ago I started seeing a new psychiatrist and this second time around I was more hopeful that things would go right. He starts me on Lithium, while slowly tapering off my older drugs (Lyrica was first to go, then Zoloft was taken out only once I started a new antidepressant). Again things seem to go better at first, but after a while things flatten somewhat, and even begin to feel worse than when i started. At this point I wasn't only feeling like shit mentally, I was also in terrible physical shape. I felt tired and achy all the time. This second psychiatrist, about 2 months ago, puts me on Wellbutrin, while eliminating Zoloft. He also prescribed me a drug I had to take for a week through IV, though I don't remember the name of it atm, which was intended to help restore my physical shape faster. Flash forward to now, and things are still going like shit and the guy says that we have to consider the possibility that I'm resistant to treatment and if so figure out a way from there.
This is kind of where I am now, I'm 24, things with university have derailed for this last year, i lost interest in the things I enjoyed (i was a full gym rat before and now i barely ever touch a weight; i was an avid reader, i loved drawing and writing and now I hardly ever do those things). I've lost the few very close friends I had and I now spend most of my days with a total disinterest for things and that feeling that if anything good were to happen, I wouldn't even be able to enjoy it. 
I wish I was more capable of expressing my feelings about the situation. All I can say is that i feel like my own reality is crumbling and it's very difficult to even tell who i am at this point.

I'd be interested to see if anyone here has had issues with drugs not working on them as intended and how they've gone forward from resistance to regular pharmaceutical treatment.
Also if you're someone who's gone through stuff like this and has been able to come out the other side, I'd be grateful to hear your takes on these sorts of situations, if there's ever a sharp turning point in how you see reality i.e. if there's ever a point where the pleasures of life do come back, if at any point you start feeling like a person again.

I have skipped some stuff as you may imagine so feel free to ask questions. I wrote the post as a spur of the moment this so I wouldn't be surprised if some stuff wasn't clear.",2,0,2025-12-19 14:33:14,get_sum_vsauce,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pqgjcz/disappointing_results_from_pharmaceutical/,depression,1.0,,0.9874,0.13273783127441663,-0.7340439558029175,1,-0.04425441164657545,0
1pqedxh,Life seems hopeless,"Don't really know what to expect from this but I have no friends to talk to but I feel hopeless.
I have social anxiety and depression.


Hi (age 31) I am from the Netherlands.
Socially I hate that when I keep trying to go out and meet new people that I don't get along with anyone.
Getting a girlfriend is hard too because I think most don't like how I am.
I can't fit in anywhere and maybe having autism can make everyone hate you for being too different.
My mind keeps telling me I am better off dead because I am lonely and I don't want to live a less worthy life and see everyone else happy.
Everyone else has the perfect personality and looks to find someone and I can't be good enough to have anyone want to go out with me.
I used to enjoy going to concerts but now it keeps bringing me down to see everyone else have friends or couples and they seem to have the best day they can together and I am just alone  too scared to approach anyone.
My social anxiety is much worse from before after being depressed and socially isolated for a long time and I barely know how to keep up a convorsation..
But I do go outside for a walk everyday.

1pqjiew,help,"Hi. (23 yo) I'd probably like some advice. I've been really down on myself over the past year. Before, everyone knew me as the most fun, interesting, charismatic person who could hook up with anyone, anytime. Now, all you can say about me is that I'm an amoebic piece of meat. I feel absolutely disgusting. I don't want to do anything; nothing attracts or interests me anymore. I've stopped developing in any way, which I used to do constantly. I try to find myself in something, but it's always the same - self-loathing and nothing else. I devoted 10 years to music, I love it. I wrote something every day, developed, tried something new. Now, I just realize that I can't do anything. I mean, I can't! Before, I could easily integrate into another completely unfamiliar field of activity, but now I can't even do anything in music. But that's not the main thing. Over the past year, so much has fallen on me that, as it turns out, I am not able to withstand. Fights with my girlfriend, moving away from her to another city, a constant, unsuccessful job search, and, again, music. If I used to wake up full of energy to create, now I wake up filled with self-loathing and regret that I woke up at all. Old friends began to notice that something was wrong and increasingly began to say, ""I have no life."" I don't know what to do. I need your advice/taunts/experience, which can perhaps help me cope with all this, because I've lost the meaning of doing anything.

The problem comes from the fact that I don't feel any passion for this course, I dont want 7 years of it, I dont want the job that comes after, and tomorrow isn't enough time. I am scared.

I don't have any interests or things that make me feel happy, my hygiene has been suffering, I don't have any friends in this university I, didnt have much friends growing up because of bullying, I don't have any dreams of having a job, I don't expect to live past 22, I feel guilt indulging in hobbies, I can't talk to my parents about it because the last time I talked to them about my grades in highschool they yelled at me and told me completing my education on time was more important than whatever ""fake mental sickness"" I was suffering from and that they felt like I was just wasting their money by failing subjects, that I should just starve on the street.

1ppqc7q,"I hate myself and my isolation is starting to scare me, need advice (21M)","Probably no one is going to read this but I’m at least writing it down. I hate everything about myself, from my looks to the way I overthink everything, I approach everything with negativity, I instinctively think people hate me or judge me, strangers or my own friends after not seeing them for a while. I’m boring, I don’t add anything to any conversation, I’m very forgettable. I’m always harsher on myself than other people.

I’m currently in med school in France and I live alone in my apartment since August 2023. I’m bad at making friends so I don’t really know a single person in my uni, I still have my friends from high school and middle school and luckily some of them are in my town even though I don’t see them often.

I don’t have siblings and the relationship with my parents is not very strong. With my mom it’s OK half the time but her love has always felt conditional and the moment I do something wrong she’s a whole different person. She starts catastrophizing and comparing me to friends or family, using anything to make me feel like a bad person or she just tells me to shut up and that she prefers when I don’t talk. I don’t open up to her about anything.

My dad is out of the equation; he just exists and pretends to be a good parental figure when family or friends come over, he fakes physical contact with me. In reality he’s either on his computer for hours or gone for the week or more for his work. The most consistent communication I’ve had with him was in middle school when he came back every weekend and told me my acne had gotten worse or I should lift weights. He can become violent when he’s mad and break plates or glasses (he rarely hit me). I try my best not to be like him.

After I got through 1st year, I slowly isolated myself, talking less and less to my friends, staying inside all day, in bed or in front of my pc, eating less, delaying grocery shopping, denying calls, and it’s now been 2 years. I would sleep during during the day and stay up all night, still do sometimes. I don’t really find games or shows entertaining anymore and I have a hard time studying even though I know I’m interested by it. The only thing that makes me feel something is music, I tried making a few tracks and mashups that I either didn’t post or removed instantly after posting them because I hate whatever I make. I don’t even know what sounds good when I am the one who makes music.

In February I got into a 1,5 month long situationship with a girl who seemed interested at first, we mostly bonded over music, but at some point, she started taking longer and longer to respond, so I stopped texting first and she never reached out again afterwards. This sounds miserable I know but it stuck with me since it was my first experience trying to date someone and I thought I was doing pretty ok. Right after we stopped talking the cycle started again and I was in my apartment again.

In middle school my Spanish teacher told me ""You won't be the one to bring money at home in the future, your wife will, if you can even find one"" and I now realize that her read is somewhat accurate.

I had already imagined the consequences of me disappearing or dying and only recently did I start considering suicide as an option and it’s the main reason why I’m writing all of this. At first it was just thinking about who would care if I decided to take action and now I have started to imagine clear scenarios and have been thinking about and looking up ways to do it. I didn’t tell anyone about it, I am aware it sounds worrying, but I am safe for now.

And even with all that, a part of me still tells me that I’m pretending, that I’m not really that sad, others have it worse, I should just brush it off. I tried seeing a psychologist (before the thoughts came in), and after 3 sessions I realized she was doing nothing but digging everywhere except where she had to, so I stopped going. Maybe she deemed my case not worthy of more? I then tried reaching out to a psychiatrist but apparently, it’s impossible to talk to anyone nowadays, they don’t take new patients anywhere. Would medication even help? Does anyone have any advice on how to love myself?

1pqfhdz,I have leaved art & drawing after twenty years focused on art creation,"Well, the issue is I need talking with someone about my deeper feelings about my current emotional situation. 
I had been drawing since I was a kid of four years old, my purpose was studying at fine arts university when I was 18 years old. So I did. 

I remember I felt very happy to be able to do Fine Arts Degree and my parents supported me a lot as they used to say I had a ""gift"" for making drawings. 
Many people including my friends, classmates, relatives and university teachers told me I was really good at drawing, so they encouraged me to look for a job opportunity on a book publishing making illustrations. The problem is I don't like books too much, I wanted to the other job instead.

After finishing my studies I tried to find an opportunity on the job I really wanted to do but I couldn't because the market is very competitive and I was asked to learn using a lot of softwares I still don't have any idea of how to use them at all.

I tried for years to learn using those painting softwares because my studies only included traditional art, which is commonly used to make art commissions and selling art pieces to collectors or trought at galleries. 

Anyway I loved making traditional illustrations when I was younger, specially while I was learning at the university but not on the real world. I mean I don't like the job possibilities which I was allowed to do as a job using drawing knowledge. 

I continued making drawings just for myself for a couple of years more while I was trying to find the job I want to do. But after more than twenty years, almost 30 years... I have completely leaved art creation to be focused on other creative process instead of drawing. 

To be honest I feel more happy with the job I doing right now and I am not regretted of leaving art but I am wondering  sometimes if I am crazy or stupid because it seems I was very good at drawing after many years of practice. 

Many people around me haven't understood my decision, while others think I was forced to leave art by someone else. But it was my own decision. 

I have a weird feeling about making drawings right now, I see it like a useless thing and I hate that feeling. 
It is normal having these thoughts after many years of drawing?

1pqiazm,I could bang my head against the wall - Christmas present story,"Something I did not do, could have lessened my depression for a few days, had I done it.

I live with my mom and she said a few days ago she wants specific new earphones.

I could have gained some great points from this and avoided some future bad moods.

I don't have a Christmas present for any one in my family (it's not an excuse but I have ADHD and extreme social anxiety - and due to it, depression), because I don't know what to get. I have the time, I don't have a job but I have enough savings as I don't pay anything at home. It's not about the money for her, but about the gesture.

I should just have gone to the small store today morning or yesterday, or on Wednesday.

Today she's ordering them on her laptop (asks if I want some too), and a sentence later says how normal sons/daughters (my sister) would have went and bought the earphones (or ordered them). She said she's not even upset as she's used to this (I honestly forgot/would have forgotten).

It might not seem important from the outside but it is, it's hard to explain. The gesture would have been absolutely great and I could have surprised her.

I'm so mad, I could have scored some really important points with little time and effort (except going to the small store but that would have been worth it. Fuck, I'm mad at myself and will be for long, it would have been such an easy score and most important I could have made her happy with the gesture (not the present or that she does not need to pay, but the gesture).

1pqeeil,is it normal to feel sues-sidal everytime I get sad,"I am 20 almost 21 and have had depression since I was prob like 12?  I didn’t get any meds till 15 and no therapy till 16. i’m in college now and not in therapy. I am mostly content now and am pretty stable but every time I get sad I feel like i’m reminded of how this is how I will always be. this is my natural state and i don’t think ill ever really be consistently happy or be able to function without meds. every time I get sad I feel like it’s my true feelings finally coming out and im just like. this is how it will always be so what’s the point. I don’t need to keep suffering. it’s mostly kind of an intrusive thought, I was genuinely suicidal for a bit when I was younger but now it only happens when I get sad and my emotions come out. I am drunk rn and this is so long and prob nobody will read it but. like the kid I babysit had me play the song “life less ordinary” earlier by carbon leaf. he’s 6 w ASD and has a 10 m/o baby sister. the song made me sob. bc they are so young and prob so hopeful and stuff. and I was like that once before too.

1pqed5r,Minha vida não tem sentido nenhum,"Cada vez que penso sobre a vida que eu tenho levado, mais desespero eu tenho. São quase 4h da manhã e eu tô pensando em me m@t@r de novo. Eu me sinto perdida, sozinha e vivendo cada dia só no automático. Eu não tenho faculdade, eu não sei o que fazer da vida, eu não tenho mais amigos, não saio de casa pra nada além do trabalho, nunca namorei e nem sequer beijei ninguém na minha vida por causa de timidez, e só consegui um emprego agora com 23 anos e temporário ainda. Eu não sinto mais felicidade jenuína e nem prazer em nada. Minhas crises não param e eu penso em me internar, porque nada, absolutamente NADA tem adiantado, e eu não acredito mais em terapia e nem em remédios. Eu não consigo parar de me sentir burra, feia, incapaz de qualquer coisa e atrasada na vida. Tenho que aguentar pessoas falando de faculdade comigo e do curso que elas fazem, do relacionamento delas, enquanto eu não tenho nada disso, e me sinto mal e como se fosse uma pessoa ruim por sentir muita inveja delas.


Eu tirei uma nota baixíssima em um vestibular que nem é tão difícil, uma das piores notas entre todo mundo que fez isso, e tô me sentindo uma acéfala com QI negativo. Eu não consigo iniciar um diálogo com o cara que eu gosto, porque na minha cabeça eu sou uma ninguém, uma pessoa completamente desinteressante, sem sal e doente demais da cabeça pra me envolver com alguém e qualquer cara teria no máximo pena de mim e nada mais, e tudo que eu faço é fingir que não sinto nada por essa pessoa e isso me destrói por dentro. Eu cheguei à conclusão que nunca vou ser nada na vida, que nunca vou compartilhar momento nenhum com ninguém e vou morrer sozinha sem nunca ter tido sequer um encontro.


As poucas pessoas que eu tinha se afastaram, e, se algum dia algum cara já gostou realmente de mim e eu não dei bola porque sou uma idiota, isso provavelmente nunca mais vai acontecer. Eu não consigo criar vínculos e manter contato com ninguém. Eu desperdicei minha adolescência toda com timidez e inseguranças e deixei todas as chances passarem e tô fazendo a mesma coisa agora na juventude.

1pqe5eq,Using this as a relief. Thanks.,"I am pregnant, married, I love with my husband, and my sister work from home at my house, I was working 3 months ago but I quit, then a month later I realized I was pregnant, I was happy, but concerned, I was no sure if my husband was happy about it, now 2 months later reality hit me hard, no too long ago I expressed to my husband my need for connection and how I would like him to have the gesture of touch my pregnant belly, or even talk with his boss about me being pregnant so they could arrange something with him to be present when I give birth both things he find them unnecessary or as he expressed is no time for it, now my sister one morning I asked her if she could make me the favor to buy some stuff for breakfast, the shop is like 3 blocks away, the reason why I asked that is becos I can't expect much time fasting, so by the moment I wake up I am already lightheaded,feeling weak with headche and I have a hard time doing things like walking without feel I gonna fade, her answer was ""I don't even take breakfast this early"" then later that day I was crying and my husband was next to me in the bed taking a break from work and he don't even asked why I was crying or if I was ok. Now this might seems like no too much for some of you, but it hurts to know that you can't count on the people you have close to care about you, I am alone even tho I love with people. And this is no the first time this happens, but it hurts like hell more now that I can't access to therapy or go to the gym :( (no with the therapist I was watching before who helped me), I created this account just to help me vent and realize some of this becos I don't have anybody to talk about this, I don't have any friends, and I can't talk with my family about this becos I don't want them to justify my reaction with me being sensitive becos of my pregnancy, and don't take me wrong my family and husband have showed me support through different parts of my life they aren't abusive they are good with me, but about emotional support or urgent needs I can't count on them and it makes me feel alone and ofc increase my desires for k*** myself.

1pqb73i,I feel really broken,"Everything is changing. And everyone is leaving me. Two of thr coworkers I love are leaving. And it makes me sad. But I feel so broken for not being able to feel sad. Ever since this semester became busy and stressful and I lost so many people I’ve just lost touch with any emotion I used to have. I’m able to know I’m sad. But I can’t feel anything. If that makes sense. It’s like my mind knows I’m sad but my feelings can’t process that cause that knowing is so far away. 

I’m losing a really good coworker who my boss loved and I know my boss is gonna get emotional which she leaves and it just doesn’t bring that feeling I used to get when people left. It’s like I’ve not only lost connection with my feelings but also lost connection with people. I don’t feel sad knowing I might never see a person again who is a really amazing person. 

Tonight is just hard cause. After tomorrow. I’m losing a two co workers with one whom I might not ever see again but I can’t feel any remorse. I can’t feel anything. And I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

I know I went through a lot this semester but I don’t feel like it justifies how much it affected me. I lost the guy I liked who I knew for a year. And I lost the guy I was having a physical  connection with to cope with that pain of not having the guy I liked. 

It just doesn’t add up. And I feel so broken. I can’t feel or express myself as much as I used to. And if I do express myself it’s not to the full extent I used to feel. Or just doesn’t add up what I really feel. 

This year has been nothing but loss. And I should be sad and remorseful but I just don’t feel anything. I don’t know if I even care anymore. 

Some part of almost wished I could just die so I wouldn’t have to stuck in this limbo. I feel like the me I used to know broke and I don’t know how to get her back. Back then it was so easy to feel happy or feel sad. But now I just feel nothing.

1pq96zu,how to stop beating yourself up mentally.,I have a lot more wrong with me than just depression but as this sub is pretty good when it comes to opinions and coping mechanisms i thought id come here. My mental health as far back as i can remember has always been subpar. Between countless therapists and a few medication changes i still cant stop mentally beating myself up for every mistake ive ever made. Ive lost all my friends because every time i become depressed or have a manic episode they either get caught in the crossfire or i leave them because i don’t do confrontation and would hate to have to explain to anyone why i freak out the way i do or say the things i say. I had a girl i was really close to and was in love with i pushed that all away..wouldn’t have been fair to keep putting her through my depressive episodes anyways but she was a great love and friend..i just want to know if anyone has ways of forgetting things they dont want to think about so i can stop beating myself up over things im never gonna be able to change.

1pq93ep,My 18th birthday is tomorrow and I'm dreading it.,"It's already bad enough that it's the holidays and everything is so cheery, but now tomorrows my birthday and I'm absolutely dreading it. Because I know I'm supposed to be happy and I just can't be. And focusing on the fact that I'm gonna spend such a milestone depressed is only gonna make me feel worse. Life doesn't seem worth living really. I'm just floating by, everyday is uneventful and lonely. I'm not attractive, I don't have any necessarily special qualities, I used to make great grades but they're mediocre now. There is absolutely nothing special about me. Everyone around me is thriving, everyone who has ever wronged me or hurt me is living their best life right now while I'm miserable. It feels like the universe is pushing me to commit suicide. I really wish I had the courage too. But I fear permanently maiming myself if it doesn't work. It feels like all these bad things happening to me is the world telling me I wasn't meant to exist. Or at least exist happily. I don't see how I could ever be content or happy ever again. I have my whole life ahead of me and I want nothing to do with it. I wanna be done. I don't feel significant or that anyone cares truly about me. They just say they do out of pity. I tell people I'm thinking about killing myself and they promise to check in but they never do.

1pqgldi,I’ve completely failed at life and genuinely want to die,"I (24M) am turning 25 on February 17. I work a seasonal job and live at home with my parents. (can’t find any work otherwise and my prospects are a complete joke) 

I literally have no friends and the only friends I did have years ago abandoned me when I was having a health issue due to flouroquinolone antibiotics (it’s called getting floxed). Although I’ve recovered from said health issue, and am healthier and stronger than ever before, the trauma of having everyone abandon me and toss me out like garbage stays with me. 

I’ve come to believe that companionship, love, and the like are completely transactional and situational. I really don’t believe such things exist anymore. 

The only other friends I had in the past literally alienated me because they found out I was a virgin at 19. Still being a virgin at almost 25, or otherwise lacking relationship experience and love generally (which is really what stings), certainly makes me feel like a loser… 

So I’ve spent most of my school years (most of which entailed me getting bullied) surrounded by people who couldn’t give less of a shit about me and the past 4-5 years completely alone. The only person who I think genuinely cares about me is my mother. 

As for my father… I’ve struggled to come to terms with this for a long time but… I FUCKING hate him. In a weird way, I also pity him. 

He’s a functional alcoholic and always has been. He never took an interest in me or my sister’s life. He was either drinking or working. He would often say some of the most hurtful things and it was to be excused away because “he was drunk when he said that.” 

I recall an instance when I was 11 or 12, and me and my sister were eating dinner. He barged in asking that we do something and we contested briefly (as children normally do) to which he replied by calling us a “couple of useless tits.” 

On my last birthday, we had a small family get together. he decided to make a spectacle while drunk by telling me how I need to get my life together and join the military to “man me up.” Nothing says “I love you son” by telling him to go get his balls blown off overseas after all…

Any time I have a smile on my face or am happy he is clearly not thrilled and often finds subtle way to put me down. 

I think he resents me because I refused to become a civil engineer (his industry) and live in his shadow. I actually was going to go to college for civil engineering. 

When I told him that, he decided that he wanted to “mentor” me which involved him referring to me as “mini me” to his colleagues who work in the industry. He would go out of his way to make me as miserable as possible during this time and I could tell this “mentoring” was just an ego trip for him. 

Suddenly, after not giving a flying fuck about me or my interests for my whole life, he suddenly cares as soon as I hit 18? It became clear to me he wanted a trophy and not a son. 

After enduring his bullshit for a short while I just said forget it with the whole civil engineering thing and since then I’ve had every career path I’ve thought of and any dreams I’ve had belittled and berated. 

The only time he did comment on my interests or pursuits (and still to this day) it was only through the form of criticism. 

Truthfully, I think he does love me but that he has crippling addiction and personality defects. He has no friends at his age and I’m afraid I’ll become just like him. 

Despite my best efforts, I can’t make enough money to get out of this fucking house, and there’s no future or hope for me to be financially independent. 

My parents are aging and clearly are going to need support into old age and it depresses me that I can’t even help myself let alone them. 

I’m embarrassed to even meet people because the look on their face says it all when I explain my situation. I’m constantly gaslit and told I just need to try harder or “just get a trade bro.” I’m too retarded to drive a car let alone do anything that requires precision and attention like being an electrician, millwright, etc.. Not to mention it seems (whether it just be my luck or otherwise) that employers will never entertain the idea of hiring me. Not even for minimum wage jobs…

Sometimes my stupidity amazes me. I’m honestly sure I have the IQ of a fucking walnut. I got good grades in high school (not a good indicator though obviously) but lack the ability to do basic human things. I struggled with social anxiety for most of my life and still do to an extent but it’s much better. I force myself to do things just because I have to. 

I honestly feel like I’m not even a human. People see me and think I’m put together because I’m good looking and in good shape (the only things I have going for me), but as soon as they learn a little about me and my circumstances they seem to pull back and scratch their heads.

I feel like I have no personality because I’ve been locked in the same 6’x3’ prison cell (my childhood bedroom) for my whole goddamn life. Whenever I try to go socialize and be a part of any community it always goes wrong and ends with me being alone again. It feels like other people just are regular humans and I’m some other fucking species that needs to be alienated and exterminated.

I fear that when my parents die, I’m going to be homeless and starve and freeze to death on the streets of Toronto. 

I’ve known some people who’ve achieved great success in their lives. They almost always were people who had excellent upbringings, were socialized properly as children, and who were encouraged. Their personalities are very extroverted, vibrant, and healthy. I’m completely the opposite. I’m defective…

Of course, contrary to what strangers have told me, I don’t walk around mopey and looking like I’m miserable. That’s not the cause of my issues and I find it extremely offensive and ignorant when people suggest that. 

However, for the past couple weeks I have been like that (mopey and depressed) simply because I’ve absolutely had it and have decided on killing myself of my 25th birthday. I’m fucking finished. The only person who I thought would support me simply directed me to contact one of those stupid helplines. 

Fuck the helplines and fuck standard care for this shit. Sometimes therapy and medication can be useful but I know what caused my depression. It’s deep rooted psychological damage from prolonged isolation, rejection, and generally shit circumstances. It’s from knowing that there is no hope for me.

I originally told myself that I would kill myself at 23 if things didn’t get better when I was 16. 23 came and went and suddenly I’m starting to realize I should’ve just followed through with my original plan…

I see going to therapy like getting a hooker honestly. It’s just paying someone to give a shit about you. 

I just want genuine human connection. I literally have been crying myself to sleep for the past week and just want someone to fucking hold me. I can’t tell anyone in my life how I’m feeling because my family will just get pissed and call me selfish, and they might thwart my plans to kill myself. 

I go to work and I’m barely keeping myself composed. My eyes are constantly red and I look miserable. I feel like I’m fighting tears every second of every day. I’m angry and devastated simultaneously.

I feel completely trapped and suffocated. I have no agency over my life whatsoever. It pains me to know there are people who just coasted through life and are living my wildest dreams effortlessly. 

On February 17 I’m going to commit to it. I just have to decide whether hanging myself with a belt, or jumping in front of the subway is the way to do it. I’m leaning more towards the former than the latter. I don’t want to die but I can’t keep doing this year after year.

1pqfjc0,Christmas Depression?,"Is this Christmas depression or holiday depression? Or a sign I need to up my meds? During the summer I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Got put on medication (which was a rough first few months) but then I finally started to feel more like myself….happier. until the holidays….in the beginning I was so excited for Halloween and I had all intentions of decorating outside and inside better than last year but my house became a wreck which stressed me out to no end but I also felt so drowned in it that I couldn’t even bring myself to tackle it. And I let my expectation of my fiancé helping out get the better of me because up to Halloween the house stayed a mess and I never finished decorating like I wanted to. Then I tried to enjoy Thanksgiving but I felt so pressured with Christmas when all the stores started pushing out Christmas November 1st that I felt I couldn’t even truly enjoy that and then I stressed about having to get Christmas stuff early because I knew by the time December came around majority of it would be gone….and that’s exactly what happened…but last year my fiancé and I had just moved into a new house and I did everything on time and was able to actually enjoy it….this year is the opposite…I’ve struggled with decorating and last week was when I really started to feel bad….like I’ve basically lost my Christmas spirit, if that makes sense. we hadn’t even gotten the tree up and my fiancé would keep telling me we’d get to it because I needed him to get it out the attic…and I know he works hard and is tired when he gets home but even on the weekends it never happened…and so I had a mental breakdown because I just felt like at this point it didn’t even matter anymore because Christmas was only two weeks away and to me I just wouldn’t have time to enjoy anything…then he finally got the tree down last weekend and said we’d work on it before this upcoming weekend…well it sat all week up until today when I finally had a little bit of excitement and decided to start stringing the lights on our tree (we like the incandescent lights so we have to string those in) but it took me most of the day..2pm-10pm….which it still never got finished because I had to keep running to the store to get more lights because somehow i kept running out…then i messed up because i didn’t realize i had more then 5 strands of lights hooked uo and what happened?? Blew out ALL the lights fuses….even the main tree plug…which means I’d have to change out all the fuses and restring the lights to fix not overdoing it…i judt felt so disappointed and so deafened because i tried so hard to enjoy it and the minute i felt like i was…boom it was all gone again…and im back to there being no point to even get to enjoy any of it and i told my fiance that im do done to the point where i want to take what ive started to do down and not even deal with Christmas this year.

I cannot help but be a pathetic and fall to my human desires, by constantly obsessing over what I do not have. I keep being such a failure and burden on the few people around me. I feel there's only so many times you can say you were depressed before people see it as a lousy excuse and view you as aggravating and lazy. I feel like I've run out of chances and everyone is tired of me. I'm tired of me. The days are starting to blend together and I constantly sleep a lot in the day. I have major depressive disorder, so it won't ever get better I fear, and it seems treatment resistant because every medicine I've tried so far just makes me go crazy and I have to go off it. It's not helped by my environment. My mom is hardly supportive. But I am dependant on her financially, because I'm autistic and cannot drive and I struggle immensely, and especially with this economy there is no hope for me. She is a bad person, I won't even get into it, then the post would be too long. I am so so sad. Sometimes I think my life is really pointless. I don't contribute anything good into this world. Besides to work, I never leave my house. I stay in bed all day long. Unless I relapse in my eating disorder, then I will exercise for hours on end until I am in pain, because the last thing I need is to be a pathetic failure AND be fat. My mom always comments negatively on my weight or my looks and it triggers me. I feel so much pain in my heart. I cannot even financially afford therapy anymore so I cannot get any help. It never was helpful anyways though. They just tell you to take deep breaths or think positive. How the fuck can I think positive when my brain is like this??? I genuinely just wish for normalcy instead of the white trash depressing life I've lived this far surrounded by poverty and criminals and alcoholics and drug addicts. I wish I had a normal life. A mom and dad that stayed married, a house, 3 meals a day served to me, and being loved. Since I was 10 I've been eating meals alone in my room. And ""meals"" is a stretch. Junk more like. I never got to have any normal life. ☹️ And worse off, I never went to college, and I probably never will. What is even the point of my existence. I was a complete accident.

After all I've suffered and haven't enjoyed, I don't care about my youth, social media, getting old, my dreams, my goals and ambitions, the people I love, or even if I die tomorrow or if a missile crashes into the whole world. I'm learning to detach myself from everything. Not even my biggest dream, which once fulfilled me, matters to me anymore, nor my hobbies, sports, or even the exercise that has helped me so much. I'm simply erasing everything: past, present, and future. I think the best thing would be to leave where I live and go live in some cold, inhospitable place in my country because, honestly, I don't care if the world ends tomorrow. It seems I'm finding peace; almost nothing matters to me anymore, not even being the loser I always was, have been, and will be.

I know some people have it worse, but it just feels like I can't go any further, and this makes me feel terrible. I guess I am trying to say that I feel like I'm not really depressed and that I am just faking it. Sure, I feel bad, but I know my emotions are the result of poor actions and decisions I have made in the past. Like, because everything is my fault, I don't deserve to feel depressed. I don't deserve to feel the way I do because *I'm* the reason why my life has gone to shit. It'd be different if I were depressed due to everything being out of my control, but that is not the case. I really believe that if I didn't exist, everything would be better. But I don't deserve that luxury because it's *my fault.* Am I wrong for feeling this way? I feel hopeless, and I believe I don't deserve anything, not even my own emotions. Does that make sense? okay i'm just rambling now i think, sorry. this probably doesn't make any sense.

1pq5asf,All out of Hope,"The past 5 years have been rough and marked with medical issues and loss.  I spent 2020 in complete social isolation due to covide and chemo.  6 months after my cancer enters remission I lost one of my 2 dogs to canine dementia.  

Just when I am finally ready to open my heart to a new dog (and the same week my mom gets me a puppy) I find out my other dog has lymphoma.  I lose him in January of 2023.  In 2024 I lost my best friend of 20 years, and since I have a tiny social circle the loss is pretty devastating that has taken time to work through. 

 In Jully I actually get the good news that after 5 years of cancer free scans I am being released from my oncologist.  Finally I was thinking I could move away from the constant subconcious fear my cancer will return only to find a suspicious lump on my now 3 year old pups hind leg.  Of course she isn't showing any clear indications of a benign cause for the lump (such as localized injury or infection).  Now I am once again waiting for cytology to find out if she too has lymphoma.  

The vet, my coworkers, and friends have done their to try to convince its too soon to worry and to have hope, but that bucket is dry.  I feel like any optimism would just be self delusion and honestly I recognize there probably is a little bit of post cancer surival ptsd convincing me that to hope for anything more is futile.  

I'm just not sure how to survive one more loss (specially if it is another loss to cancer).  I also feel guilty whenever I am this depressed.  I know there are so many people who have it so much worse than me so I don't really have the right to feel depressed.  Its silly I know but who am I fall apart because my dog might not even have cancer when people are surviving terminal diagnosis, war, and living in refugee camps.

On the pharma front I can't tolerate SSRIs (restless leg) and the wellbutrin hasn't cut it for a while.  The buspirone has turned my daily anxiety down from a 9 to a 6, but it is still there.

Not one aspect of life going well. Rockbottom. Either i improve or I die right now. And it doesn't seem like I'm going to improve so I'm choosing to die. I don't want to live. I've lost my faith and I've lost my spark.

I have really been contemplating suicide and there have been times when I almost went through with it, but I have stayed because of my family. However, my relationship with my family took a tense turn and it has made me even more upset and now I feel as though I have no reason to stay - since I now feel so much more distant with my family. I am going to give myself a bit more time to fully think it through, but now I'm just wondering how I tell my loved ones? or what do I tell them? Should I tell them I'm struggling? How should I do that?? we have never really been the family to have deep discussions like this so it all makes me very uncomfortable. they dont even know im taking lexapro. Im lying to them about a big part of my life and I feel weird about it, but I also dont think I can stomach the thought of them knowing it all.

I'm writing this from a place thats been buried in me for a while. I'm a terrible person who's been wanting to die for a long time and hopefully sooner rather than later. Due to some recent events it just made too much sense for me to go. I grew tired of living the ""groundhog day"" life I've been living where every day felt exactly the same. I had it good for a while especially recently. I won't say when I'm going or where. But I'll just say it'll be soon enough.
I never fit in here. I lived. I explored a fair chunk of the world. Fucked a model once. And now I'm just ready to call it quits. I'm frankly exhausted of the day to day shit. I'm tired of the politics at work. I'm tired of just feeling like everything is a chore. I tried the shrink, the alcohol and drugs. Nothing is good enough to keep me here.

he attends a good private school, he has lots of friends, he is very bright and wants to be an engineer. recently, he has not been doing well. he rarely goes to school anymore, only about 2 times a week, he sleeps or games all day, and he doesnt eat very much, only about 1 meal and a couple snacks per day. i dont know what to do to help him because it feels more serious than just a lazy teenage phase.  
as i said, i never really considered mental health much before. when i heard about people having depression and doing things because of it, it felt so foreign. for example, my cousin died of an overdose a couple years ago, and some of my grandparents have diagnosed severe depression. ive realized that it may be a trait in my family. im sorry if this seems insensitive.  
im really scared my brother is going to harm himself. i dont know what to do. i dont know if im overreacting, but i just figured i should ask just incase, as i am very unfamiliar and unexperienced with this sort of thing.

TW for mentions of mentall illness , su1cidalness , nsfw content [talk about hypers3xuality and s3xual behaviour (nothing too graphic) , mention of an unspecified k1nk] , mentions of (hypothetical) p3dophilia .

I'd thought about it a couple times, but yesterday i started thinking more seriously about it and spiraled BADLY, i need to do something about it but idk what. 

so, I (18M) have had a reasonably high s3x drive for a while, despite having had dysthymia for over five years and being on meds. but it honestly skyrocketed this year; I'm transgender, i started hrt and and testosterone has had a pretty intense effect on that area. during this summer it got to the point where I'd touch myself around twice (as in two different times) a day in average. I'd been reading about hypers3xuality for a while, and during this year i kind of came to terms with the fact that I'm as sure as i can be without having a professional diagnosis that i am. it was tricky at first because I've barely had s3xual experiences, and they definitely weren't risky, but once i realized that the criteria wasn't limited to physical s3x, it was pretty clear.

now, during the last year or so i also started to explore a bit a k1nk i hadn't been very aware of. more than a k1nk it's a paraphilia, really, I've always been very drawn to it even as a little kid, and i realized around last year that it now s3xually aroused me. it's not an inherently s3xual thing, it's actually not even s3xual at all. i've never told anyone about it because it deeply ashames me and i was just planning on taking it to the grave, but here we are. 
so i started consuming nsfw content (mostly fanfiction, some p0rn but barely) related to that, and i was amazed by how quickly it got me off. and with my libido being off the rails because of the testosterone shots and my hypers3xual tendency, it quickly started to resemble an add1ction. and yeah all of that sounds pretty bad, but that's not the problem; i wouldn't tell anyone, but it's not eating at me, it's not wrong per se.

my problem comes now. during the time I've been consuming s3xual content related to that, some of the content portrayed minors. minors as in kids. not real, just written on ao3, but still kids nonetheless. and i got off to it the same i did to the rest of the content. it was not a one time thing. and i started spiraling recently because now I'm seriously worried about whether that could mean I'm a ped0phile or not. the thing is, I'm not aroused by kids, and what was appealing about the content was not the fact that they were kids. I wasn't actively looking to consume that kind of content portraying minors, it's simply as if my head, in that kind of obsessive and unhealthy headspace that characterizes hypersexual bad episodes where all i thought about was wanting to get off, didn't make a distinction. i would absolutely never harm a kid in ANY way. so now i just don't know if it's my hypers3xuality fully materialising and actually causing me problems (because this is distressing me really badly), if I'm a ped0phile, or if my morals are just way fucking worse than i thought. I'm disgusted with myself and i deeply regret it. I've completely cut down on it, on all of that specific content, because i feel guilty and i feel the need to punish myself somehow.
i think you can understand why i can't talk about this with people in real life. I'm considering talking to my best friend, but I'm still extremely ashamed and genuinely terrified they'll see me as a bad person, because that will confirm i am one. yesterday i started thinking about it seriously, reading about ped0philia and similar stuff, and while the main criteria (which is being s3xually aroused by kids) doesn't apply, i can't get it out of my head. afterwards i broke down in the street because i came to the conclusion that I'm a ped0phile and i have to kill myself. I don't think I've ever felt so hopeless, and so utterly disgusted with myself, genuinely feeling that the best place for me is six feet under. i have a tendency to overthink, to intrusive thoughts, and I'm medicated for anxiety as well. so I don't know if my head is playing me or not. when i read about hypers3xuality, many people talk about having indulged in s3xual acts or behaviours that didnt feel right, they were deeply ashamed of and didn't truly want, about how the s3xual desire and obsessiveness about it spiral out of control and bring you to bad places. but I don't know if thinking about that applying to me would be wishful thinking.

please, tell me what you think, i don't know who to ask for help or who to talk to, i can barely eat or function as usual because i feel so much dread about this. I'm not in danger, I don't intend to actually die by suicide imminently, but as i guess you can understand this is seriously fucking me up. also I'm sorry this got so long it's my first time doing this and its a complicated situation so i wanted to make sure to explain myself properly. thank you for reading this far, take care of yourselves.

1ppxuog,Miss out on every teenager experience,"I'm 21 now but I still feel really bad that I'm adult now but never ever got to experience or Live my teenage years, because of different things poverty, society, religion, bad country. And I mean everything I did absolutely nothing expect rotting on bed Being depressed the only experienc was watching a lot of anime and that's about it.


Gaming impossible too expensive and I feel I missed a huge part of being a teenager in my generation, relationship kissing hugging absolutely anything impossible because of religion and society, having a friends group and doing stuff together also Impossible I was so introverted and after I got two good friends all our families were strict and religions we Barely did anything together expect in school, partying and trying to get drunk and having fun and just being stupid enjoying the moment forget about it it's literally enough reason to get killed from a family here as a woman, having a personal room full with stuff I love and posters and a desk and a bed hell no broke asf never got to have my personal room in my entire life, wearing clothes that match my personality also no society and poverty, traveling which is something I really really passionate about it impossible, doing sport eating healthy and going to gym also Impossible even though I was also passionate about some sports, going to do running in the morning I'm a ho for some reason and looking for harassmen, concert is impossible my city is extremely boring and one we got one concert in a life time of course society called women going to it as ho and shame on there Fathers for letting them go, same with football Stadiums.


I can rant for hours about this, one I turned 20 I thought things will get better I thought I will get more freedom then I faced the fact that women are never adults in my country, sure they're adult to do duties and cooking and raising children but never adults to have there freedom and make their own choices it's just we're controlled by parents then we're controlled by husbands and of course always by society, but never free NEVER, and of course we have some western who's saying how much we don't need feminism and we have to value family as a woman, you know what fuck family I just want to be isolated and do whatever I want for the rest of my life, to me a family should always want happiness for their members not abuse and control.


I wanted to get a stable job and start buy stuff for myself but my country is shi, part time job doesn't exist but part time job payments does, so now I have to continue my university and all the jobs I find are full time jobs and whenever I try to find a way to leave this country forever it's always very difficult it feels like I'm stuck here forever.

1pqb6p3,Passive suicidal tendencies,"I 18(f) have been dealing with passive suicidal tendencies for about 6 years straight and it’s getting worse the older I get. I never expected myself to live this far into life, and the reasons for my passive tendencies are becoming more and more prominent in my life. I am Muslim and it’s the norm for me to get married soon since I am considered an adult now. But I don’t have any urges to get married, especially not to the Muslim men in my culture(but that’s a whole other thing), I don’t want kids which is almost not even a choice in my family(everyone has kids, as soon as you get married, next is kids). I just started college and already failed my first semester and they took away my scholarship so I have to pay tuition out of pocket, my parents are denying to help me so I’m in debt at 18 years old. I don’t even have a major, I am only attending because it’s what my parents want for me, so basically I’m in debt right now for no apparent reason. My insurance has declined me coverage so that’s more debt onto my plate, I only work a part time job that barely suffices me gas money. I have no ambitions to have a career, a marriage, kids, or anything that has been set out for me. I can’t even commit suicide because my family would be ashamed of me sinning since suicide is haram. Every night around 3am I sneak out of my house and walk around aimlessly hoping for someone to kill me so I can be blameless in my death but everyday I return alive at 5am and lay in my bed pretending I didn’t go out in the hope of my death. The only way I can fall asleep is by imagining my death and everyone reaction which feels vain and egotistical. I have no motive to keep living except the disappointment of my family. I don’t really know what the purpose of this post is. I tried talking to my cousin about this but she showed disgust in my suicidal tendencies which immediately made me shut down, she started talking about god and what is set out for me and really played up my religious guilt. I can’t talk to my friends about it because they just tell me to leave my family if the culture and religion is making me so depressed, but it isn’t just that, I just feel like my life was never meant to exist( I was an accident, all my siblings are 30+), and regardless of what my parents have set out for me, I have no ambitions whatsoever, something that my non Muslim friends don’t really get and they’re really set that if I leave my family I will become better, but I think having no family and being disowned will make me worse in the long run.

1ppppuo,I love my parents but I resent them for having me,"As the title says. I was an accident, my parents were in their early 20s. I almost died when I was born and I’ve often wished I had. I love them so much, but lately I’ve been feeling resentment towards them for having me. The thing that upsets me the most is that according to mum her reaction was ‘what ever happens, happens’. My life and entire existence was just a flippant decision, it’s insulting, I never asked them to have me, I don’t want to exist in this world anymore. My parents both have neurological disabilities which I’ve inherited as well as other chronic health issues I’ve gotten from my mum. They both have severe trauma that they’re just now in recent years are processing/seeing therapy for. She also told me that if her and my dad had been diagnosed with everything when they were younger they wouldn’t have had kids. I love them and have never told them I hate them for this because they’re already stressed with life as is. The world is awful and they know it, why did they have to have me. She also told me that if I or my brothers (yes they had more kids after me) died she’d kill herself. I feel like I have to survive because she needs me to even if I don’t want to. The only reason I still want to live is my cat, if she dies then so will I. I’ve felt scared to mention this to my psychologist because I’m worried she’ll tell my parents and they will walk on eggshells around me and hide all the Panadol and ibuprofen because that’s what I used in my first attempt at my life and because of my chronic pain I really do need them just to survive some days. The world is fucking nightmare and my parents despite knowing this had children and know I’m just as fucked mentally as they are. I wish my mum aborted me when she had the chance. I can’t keep doing this shit anymore. I love them but why make such a stupid choice. Why is my life reduced dumb decision to keep me when they didn’t really care either. I feel like a mistake. I just want this all to be over. I think it’s selfish for parents to feel this way and still have kids, yet I could never say this to them I can’t bear to hurt them despite this, I love them and want them to be happy.

1pq65s7,I’m pretty convinced life is probably not for me,"I don’t think I want to continue living

I’m 14F and life is so stressful. Ik I’m still a kid, obviously kids aren’t supposed to have so much stress but I do. I’m a weak person. I hate getting mad, I hate upsetting people, and I hate creating problems. I have so many problematic people in my life I really lost hope in creating friends or talking to people. I want to just be in my own little room and be alone. 

My parents aren’t great, my mom is cheating on my dad with 2 guys and my dad is probably doing the same with girls. They always say I am having sex with boys even though I’m not. I don’t talk to boys or have any guy friends so idk why they always think that.  

One time in Abu Dhabi I was gonna ride a rollercoaster and the line took an hour. We had to put our phones away in a locker, so I was just enjoying hearing the kids infront of me talk. When I came back I was so happy and felt great. When I checked my phone it was full of my mom saying “I shouldn’t have trusted you” and stuff. I called her and asked “what’s wrong?” She complained about how she kept searching for me panicking and saying who am I with and investigating while screaming at me. I did tell her I was going to that specific rollercoaster beforehand, i still don’t know why she was mad. When I came to my family they checked my phone and didn’t find anything sexual.

I will be honest, I do use porn as stress relief. I always try to find really intense stuff just so the dopamine goes up. But again this is probably hypersexuality because I wasn’t protected as a kid and was exposed to intimacy at a young age. Also my dad always hints sexual stuff about my body and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Thing is my mom is there and she doesn’t say anything.

This is just a portion but I really wanted to vent. Also friends and classmates aren’t great, I feel lonely most of the time and i never feel cared about. Looking at young photos of me makes my heart hurts from guilt. I also envy some people cause they always tell me how great their parents are. I hate how happy they are when they speak. I never felt happy talking about my parents, I never felt the mother daughter relationship or father and daughter relationship. Ik I’m wrong for being jealous, but I genuinely feel annoyed when people talk positively about their lives cause I just feel useless.

People say it gets better, but I don’t see that for myself. I wish I killed myself. I had tried to kill myself before but I never had the courage and I feel pathetic for that.

1ppqb60,Feeling Lonely… Would love to just talk with other people…,"It’s a rough time in my life even though by outer appearances, it shouldn’t be. I’m in my mid-thirties and I have a beautiful wife and baby, and we plan to have more. I have a work-from-home job that pays well and has great benefits. I own a home in a nice area. It’s tough for me to keep friends and a network with my intermittent depression, but I still have a strong family system. Point being is I have a lot going for me they I had to work for and I should be proud… and I am… but it feels hollow.

I feel guilty saying that because I’m raising a family, but it’s true. I feel so lonely… it’s chronic. The accompanying depression is essentially lifelong and is well-treated, but the damn loneliness is so hard to shake. I value and strive for these deep, impossibly close connections with people, and anything less feels… empty? I know that’s a bad way to operate, but this dysfunctional framework is so ingrained into me. Lacking these intense connections make feel alone and like I’m just floating through life. What’s sad is I do have a strong connection with my wife and baby, but it doesn’t feel like enough to me. How messed up is that?

It’s all compounded by the fact that men’s mental health is often over-looked. With my depression/loneliness being lifelong, I’ve become so damn good at hiding it you would never know from outer appearance. To the point where I think if I told someone who sees me on a regular basis that I’m depressed, they would laugh thinking it was a joke. I’m extroverted, friendly, and energetic, and it’s so exhausting. I feel like that’s what people require from me, and unfortunately, base that off of personal experience. My wife is a wonderful person who cares about me a lot, but I can tell that even she looks at me with a bit of contempt if I vent or “give in” to my depression for a weekend.

It’s sometimes confusing that I used to be the literal opposite of this growing up and in college… wore my heart or my sleeve and was so expressive and open in my communication, but I quickly learned there’s no place for that as an adult. The reality is nobody cares about your struggle when they evaluate your performance. Nobody cares about it when they’re evaluating you as a support system to start a family. Nobody cares about it when they themselves have a million things to worry about in their own adult life. Life won’t wait for you. Opportunities will simply pass you by. So I double-down and just try to be a rock for the people that need me… even though I struggle so much. I try to live in service of family even though it’s difficult for me to be happy.

Anyways, I really came here to vent & see if other people have similar experiences.

1ppxjbr,being an adult sucks,"i genuinely don’t know how i will make it to adult hood. i am an 18 year old girl who had to drop out of college because i have a severe chronic illness that we still haven’t figured out what it is. i worked for awhile when i came home but the hours were dwindling and my energy was terrible. at the same time this is happening i got an apartment. then my car broke down so my dad is lending me his car that i can buy but it would be $5,000. i am also already $5,000 in debt to the college i went and had to drop out of. i’m now without a job, without school, and without friends cause they all went off to college. 

i panic when thinking about all of the things i have to pay for in the future, and how i have to go back to school eventually or even just having to clean and shower myself every day. there are so many reasons for me not to stay here anymore. i am not living a sustainable life and it’s starting to affect my hopes and dreams for the future. i don’t even have any anymore. the only reason im still here is strictly because my roommate would have to find a new roommate again (i was the new roommate at first) and my dad would never get paid for his car. and whatever friends and family blah. i hope in the future i become a stay at home mom and get my decisions made up for me. i guess that might be a hot take",3,0,2025-12-18 23:32:15,FederalOwl8627,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppxjbr/being_an_adult_sucks/,depression,0.72,,-0.6685,0.06021324354657688,-0.9019525647163391,1,-0.6394836336488542,-1
1pq8dne,Everything sucks,"Everything sucks. The world is shitty, everyone is shitty. There’s so much abuse and oppression and violence and suffering, and there’s nothing I can do about it. Politics and economics and whatever suck. The systems are bullshit, everything is shit. My negative thoughts have been proven right time and time again.

I’ve tried to speak out about my beliefs, but no one seems to think the same as me. Things like fictional pedophilia and zoophilia are acceptable? Everyone is telling me to keep my opinions to myself? Does no one else think that those things are bad? Even when they’re fictional, they can influence others. I wouldn’t trust someone who likes consuming fictional incest and pedo stuff to be a parent or look after a kid. 

And when kids stumble upon stuff like that, they might try to act it out on other kids or animals. Isn’t that bad? But people tell me that I need to keep my opinions to myself if I can’t handle that other people’s opinions differ. Everyone seems ok with all of this cause it’s ’fictional’ and I feel fucking crazy. If all of this is normalised, I don’t want to live here. I don’t want to be alive on this earth.

I have no one to turn to. Nowhere is safe. Nothing makes me happy anymore. My own personal issues suck. I’m so fucking done with this, I’m done with everything. Is this really how life is?

I'm so tired I don't even have tears left. It's an exhaustion that goes beyond the physical; it's of the soul. I feel like life isn't about living, it's just about enduring one day after another, locked in my room, seeing no future, with no energy for anything.

The world outside hurts. I isolated myself because people hurt me, and now the loneliness is killing me too. I don't trust anyone anymore. Sometimes all I can do is hug a stuffed animal to not feel completely alone, because the longing for a real connection tears me apart inside.

Dark thoughts come when I can't sleep. I've already made an appointment with my psychiatrist because I know this is getting out of hand, but in the meantime... how do you bear it? How do you carry this constant weight of feeling worthless, like you don't fit in, like there's no way out?

But the security was super tight, no phones, no water bottles, only water we could get was at the fountains and they were pissy with us for using them.

1pq7kvr,i suck at everything and i miss my ex,"i suck at everything i do. i don't have any hobbies cause i'm embarrassingly bad at everything, and if it involves other people i just feel like i'm wasting their time. recently, i started jiu jitsu and i'm so god awfully terrible at it. even though it's expected that i'm bad at first, my lack of athleticism and flexibility made me what i think is worse than most people starting out. sometimes i feel that no matter how much i try, i will never reach a level at a skill or a hobby where i would impress myself or anyone else. I can only ever achieve mediocrity at best.

I've felt this way for a long time. i remember when i was in grade 3 i had to list things i was good at and couldn't list anything. i remember when i was in grade 7 my ""friend"" told me i ""suck at everything and at life,"" which i believed and still do 13 years later. 

The only thing I'm somewhat good at is my job which i hate. I'm just a measly line cook. a profession that seems to ragged on by society. great. i'm a good line cook. woohoo

When i was with my girlfriend, she was always able to convince me that there were things that i was good at. We broke up a couple years ago, and now she's dating someone that's taller than me, better looking than me, and like most people, probably better than me in just about everything. i don't fault her for leaving me, i just miss having someone so loving and supportive. i know i have to find that in myself, but loving and supporting myself is just another thing i'm terrible at.

1pq7346,I’m lost,"Throwaway I’m 22m I don’t know how to cope with anything anymore

Back story, I’ve always struggled with confidence issues, I’ve always been overweight and felt ugly, always been shy and antisocial. For some reason ever since I was incredibly young, my idea of a perfect life was finding the perfect person, the perfect wife for me, keep in mind my definition of “perfect” is someone that I love unconditionally and someone that loves me unconditionally. Growing up I never had attention from girls and I could never reach out. I barely ever have friends and I usually lose the ones that I do. When high school hit my freshman year I met this girl let’s call her Nicole (fake name obviously) I had a crush on her but she was 2 years older and had a boyfriend, however me and Nicole were instantly best friends. I was quickly able to get over my crush and never though much about it, time passed and we stayed very close friends, my senior year when I was 18 I got a job at a retail store, met a coworker there, she was 4 years older than me, had a newborn baby, and was engaged, me and her quickly became good friends, and for some reason she came on to me, love bombing me and doing all this stuff telling me we were soulmates and all this stuff. I hate cheaters but I’m not innocent, that girl was my first kiss, my first sexual experience, (we never went all the way) I was totally prepared to become a step dad at 18. That relationship lasted about a year before she suddenly cut everything off and she was pretty cruel about it. I entered a long depression for years, panic attacks, depression the whole 9, for years the only reason I felt like I got through it was because of my best friend (Nicole) now Nicole is still dating her boyfriend let’s call him (Mike) they were both my best friends at this point and I had no lingering feelings for Nicole, however our relationship was always in a grey area, we were always the people that were like “ew we would never be attracted to each other nobody would have to worry about us doing anything”. Now about a year and a half ago, Nicole, Mike, and I all moved out together into our own appartment, now Mike had a traveling job where he was gone the weekdays and home the weekends, so me and her were alone a lot. Which was nothing unusual for us. As you can expect one day me and her got drunk and kissed, the next day when we were sober we kissed again to “test” everything. From that point on we were pretty much in a full blown relationship, she took my virginity when I was 21, but she was also my best friend on this whole planet she’s always been there for me, she knows me better than anybody on this planet. Now she’s wanting to stay friends but also stay with him, he lost his job so he’s home everyday. I’m completely in love with her I miss her so much and it’s all gone, I’ve told her how I feel but nothing has changed. For context Mike treats her like dirt, makes fun of her looks makes fun of her weight, has tried to break up with her for a long time but is always to scared to go through with it, (these are all things he’s actually told me) most recently, before me and her started our relationship, they had a very early term miscarriage, where he belittled her and made fun of the miscarriage because he was so relieved not to be a dad, he never comforted her nothing. And like I said I’ve known them both for almost 10 years, it’s ALWAYS been like this, he treats her like dirt, she doesn’t want to leave. I know I can’t force them to separate but I don’t know how to cope. I went from one dump depression that I thought would kill me, to another one with her, except this time I didn’t just lose a relationship, I lost my best friend of 10 years, my other best friend, and the relationship I know we could have, not to mention I have to live with them for the next 7 months, so I have to see them together everyday.

1pq6nyh,How to help my friend,"Hello. I’m not sure if this is the correct page to post this. But my friend was diagnosed with major depression awhile back. He says everything is pointless, things will never get better and this has been his life for 29 years. He has now said that if things don’t get better in 6 years, he’s going to end his life. I don’t know what to do. He lives states away from me. He said if I tell his family or notify anyone, he will consider it a betrayal because he has a vape and guns. Which can be considered a felony to have both in possession. I am NOT concerned with him harming anyone else. He saw a therapist that he waited a year for and the guy was awful and not helpful. My friend spiraled even more. Sometimes if we disagree, he’ll be like “well sorry for being a burden”. When I never said he was or acted like he was. He told me to forget about him. He’s acting like nothing good will ever come to him. And no matter what I say, he never agrees. How do I help him? I want to tell our mutual friends but I don’t want everyone to gang up on him at once. But it also upsets me that he tells me he plans to kill himself in 6 years, then tells me I can’t help him and don’t tell anyone else. Why do I have to watch him suffer and then die? I don’t know how to help him. I had to basically beg him to demand another therapist because he wouldn’t do it. So that’s good at least. But still, I’m worried that won’t help him either. But how can I, who lives very far away from him, help him in any way shape or form? I don’t want him to suffer. I want him to be happy and thriving. He will say things like “this is why I rather not talk about it” but I don’t want to ignore my friend suffering. Anything will help.

1pq69c3,No voice,"Do you ever feel like you have no voice? 
Like no matter how much you try and speak up for yourself that nobody hears you? 
I have spent my whole life with people ignoring what I’m saying and deciding for me. 
People love to tell me what I should be doing, how I should be feeling or acting. 
Sometimes I can even be speaking to someone and I see they have zoned out.
Today I was talking to someone and wanted to discuss a movie and they laughed and said they don’t really care. I know they didn’t say it to hurt me and they are of course allowed to not care but it hurt me for. 
I carried on talking about it anyway and they showed some interest but still it’s sticking with me that they don’t care and that I forced them to be interested in something that mattered to me. 
I seem to talk about a lot of things the people around me don’t seem to care about and it makes me feel like such a freak.

I’m also struggling at the moment with a relapse of eating disorder as it’s the only thing I can control. Nobody seems to hear me when I speak so part of me thinks, maybe if they see me waste away, maybe if I collapse, maybe if I break, they might finally see my pain. 

I’m so deeply in love with someone that doesn’t seem to care about me at all. Sometimes I think he does and then other times I feel like he wouldn’t care if he never even saw me again. 
It hurts me so much to think I would die for him and he probably goes through whole days or weeks without me crossing his mind once. 

I feel like a ghost just floating through life and I’m not even sure if anything is even real anymore. 
Maybe I died a long time ago. 
Maybe I was never alive at all. 

I’m screaming inside and nobody can hear me. Every day I fade away a little more hoping someone will notice or that he will wrap me in his love and make it all better again. 
But he never will. 
He doesn’t know how. 
I don’t even think he would if he could as I don’t seem to be worthy of being loved.

1pq0r8t,anxiety bordering obsessive rumination,"I've been isolating myself, and literally go hours doing nothing but thinking about my past mistakes and regretting about them. I feel so guilty and hate myself so much for what I did. I took a long time to love someone because I had abandonment issues since childhood. I can't focus on anything, even the most basic things. I don't like eating anymore and i've been avoiding socializing aswell. I've been losing weight aswell to the point that i'm underweight now. I lost my parents in early age and I was avoidant in terms of love life. I love someone but when I just started liking her, I just had a few doubts, some of them were my own insecurities and others were just trust issues which could be resolved by just communicating which is bothering me the most. But instead of communicating, I kept passive communication and did not try enough meanwhile she was in love with me this whole time and she kept trying but I just could not notice enough. When I started trying aswell and I committed, it was too late. We've some cultural issues and other restrictions right now which could be resolved only if I had committed earlier because we both were at a better stage at that point. I can't share much details but I am sure about one thing which is that we wouldn't have had these issues if I had committed earlier, now our relationship will most probably have to end in a few months because we won't be able to marry due to those issues. I've realized what we have is so special and unique but too late..She's literally the best girl I've ever met in my life and the kind of personality she has is so rare and compatible with me that and she's literally everything I wanted from my partner. I never thought I'd say this for someone but she's my everything now and I can't live without her and Im sure i'm never gonna move on from her. But I realized all that so late which is why I just keep thinking about past days whenever she's not talking to me. Even if I think about past day for some other reason, I immediately think how I could've changed things if I go back to that time.. I just can't focus on anything these days.

1pq637b,Isolating myself,"With the end of the year right around the corner I have realized that I've yet again found myself in a worse spot then last year. I'm genuinely tired of it and I don't think I got it in me to hold out for hope, to try one last time and to get up again. Over the last few days I have drawn back from many social interactions, be it in school or at home. I have a few online friends were I haven't joined them in VC's or anything like that. I feel terrible for doing it, but on the other hand it took them 3 days before even DMing me some random memes. I don't think they know how bad I'm doing, for maybe one you I flat out told that I was depressed and suicidal, but he has yet to even say anything. And while I feel bad for ignoring them, I don't want them to get feel too sad when I'm gone. I'm trying to get out of everybody's mind, annoy them before the holidays so they don't want anything to do with me for a few days and then just kick the bucket. I can't get myself to reach out for help, to try and tell them how I feel. I feel so awful for wanting to die right now too, with Christmas and new year so close... But I can't do this shit anymore. Also, I'm scared of surviving an attempt after leaving notes or anything which is also why I withdrew myself from everyone.

after he returned home, we talked and he broke up with me. it just seems so unfair that when he was on his ass, i helped him out and when i needed him, he left me and now it seems like he’s going on woth his life as if nothing happened and how he didnt ruin someones life. im tired of feeling the pain every single day. im tired of constantly trying in my academics and trying to please everyone. i wanna kill myself so much and no one can convince me otherwise not to do it. its just annoying that all my family and friends keep telling that life is worth living and i do see that, its just that i still choose not to live life.

1pq5zu9,"i have an existential crisis once it gets dark out, almost every night.","when i wake up in the morning I feel well enough. i do my hobbies and tasks in the day, and have fun drinking tea and meditating. but once it gets dark out, and this started once the days got shorter for winter, i suddenly start having an existential dread creep over me and settle on my chest.  

i start getting overwhelmed at the thought of my position in a limitless reality and the limitless possibilities of things that can happen to me, i often go through an ultimatum of either becoming enlightened or spending forever in ignorance, enlightenment seems like too great of a thing for my tiny mind to bear, yet going forever without becoming enlightened seems unbearable as well. the bigness of existence just becomes too much to bear and it seems it must all be faced at some point, what use is hiding? My chest usually has a heavy, weary pain in it during this.

anyway this usually incapacitates me until i manage to fall asleep, yet when i wake up i consider my nightly terrors to be silly, and that there is ultimately nothing to be afraid of. truth is love, and that is the only reality. i am also optimistic about the future.

so i continue doing well with my day until evening comes about and it starts again. anyone else go through something like this? I am curious why its always at night. i have found that meditating or cuddling with a large blanket with no media, screens, or music helps me reach a state of mental quiet. sometimes even completely stilling my thoughts helps me reach a peaceful place. if i am able to.

Being young makes this lonelier. People don’t really get what it’s like to grieve your health this early or sit with this much uncertainty every day.

1ppn8l1,There is nothing after death and it terrifies me.,"One day, you and I will close our eyes for the last time. There will be nothing. You can't even describe it as ""peace"" as peace implies the lack of conflict or strife, when nothing is nothing. You no longer exist. I am nothing but electrical signals in the brain - once those stop firing off, that's it. 

It... hurts. All I know is being. And... the acceptance of that fact renders life meaningless and empty. Morality, for example, is not real. There is no real consequences to any action. No punishment suffered or pain inflicted will matter when you die and those affected die. You can't even be remembered forever as entropy guarantees the cessation of of all thought universally. 

I just... can't stand it. It all means nothing. It meaning nothing does give it meaning, as meaning itself is a delusion.

1ppkxpf,I'm ruining my partner's life with my depression and I don't know how to stop.,"Hi. I'm desperate, and I'm hoping someone out there can help me.

First, some context.

I (32f) and my partner (33f) have been together for over 7 years and known each other much longer. We met in a creative writing group and both have (had) a lot of passion for writing. My partner just spent the last 3-4 years battling a very serious illness. We're on the other side but she has side effects from it that may be permanent, though we hope they will get better with time. These side effects make it hard for her to do things like drive or do a lot of physical things. She nevertheless has 2 jobs and is going back to school, and does most of the planning on our lives. Because of her difficulties I do most of the cooking and chores like cleaning and taking care of the pets. Things should be okay. Things should be better. But they're not and it's my fault.

I have struggled with depression since her initial diagnosis when I moved to live in the same city and changed jobs. I work 3 12 hour days as an emergency nurse (yes, I realize the irony). We both have therapists individually and we also have a couples counselor. I additionally see a psychiatrist and am on wellbutrin. Okay. Enough context.

Today was the worst day of her life, she said, and one of the 3 worst days of mine (the other 2 are related to her illness). We have planned to get married at the end of the year but she told me today that she doesn't know if it's a good idea anymore. She said she doesn't want to live the rest of her life lonely and miserable with a partner who doesn't get excited about what she's excited about or share on her joys. She's told me that the only time I seem to have any emotion is when I'm crying.

We have continued to write creatively together over the years. She was unable to do this during a large part of her fight with her illness and now she feels up to it again-- just in time for me to crash. It has gotten harder for me to write with her, even though I love it--it's the only hobby I feel like doing anymore. Today when she asked why I haven't written with her today because she was excited and waiting all day, I told her that when she pushes like that it feels like an obligation. She became extremely angry and upset and told me that she's done. She said I only care about my own feelings, I don't think about her, and do I know how hard it is for her to have muse for writing again and be the only one. I asked her point blank if she wanted to leave me. She said no, but she can't promise she'll stay and be miserable and lonely forever. She said she's only with me because she hopes things will change.

I went home after this argument (I dropped her off at work) and considered hurting myself as a ""punishment"" because whenever we argue it is always my fault, it is always me hurting her, and I feel like such a horrible person for it. I didn't go through with it, but I physically had the knife pressed into my arm. It is not the first time I have had this thought. I feel incredibly guilty about that too, because I know it would only make things worse. I called a crisis hotline after I put the knife away, but I still feel horrible and guilty. I feel like a burden who is just dragging my partner down and ruining her life by existing in it. I have not told her that I almost self harmed because I don't want to sound manipulative.

Does anyone have some guidance for me? I am at the absolute end of my rope. ",20,5,2025-12-18 13:02:27,Fearless_Total3118,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppkxpf/im_ruining_my_partners_life_with_my_depression/,depression,0.95,,-0.9962,-0.034143894300144306,0.0,1,-0.3056887788600288,-1
1pq5aq7,Things that happened to me seem so small until I put them together and realize how it affected me,"I feel like recently I've been more reflective on my issues and what they stem from and it hurts a lot especially when i feel like knowing doesn't make a difference, it makes it worse. I've been reflecting on big moments in my life because I feel like maybe I'm being dramatic. I don't think I am. First I start off with my parents fighting all the time and splitting up. Then my mom has an abusive boyfriend, not as much to me but he threw stuff at me. his daughter and I would shower together and she would sexually assault me. Then later on I'm struggling with friendships and my dad verbally abusing me, at the same time I'm starting to take on the role of the mother in my house to my mom and sister. my anxiety and depression start getting worse and my school work starts to suffer. It gets so much worse in highschool, then im sexually assaulted by my friend after she got me drunk. things keep getting worse with being able to keep up with friends, with school, and i have to do all the cleaning around the house with no help at all. Then at the same time my sister is struggling very outwardly while I have no capability to express myself, I basically become my moms therapist and that continues. I start binge eating to cope as well as measures taken to counteract it.I graduate highschool barely and lose my friends. I work and thats basically all I can do. For a while I kept up with house work, got a bit better with my bad habits. then a few months ago I'm raped/sexually assaulted twice in two weeks. That was the catalyst for where I am now. My sleep has gotten horrible, my binging and purging is everyday, im so anxious and depressed, yet unable to let anyone know. I;m just so fed up with it and myself. I tried therapy but couldnt speak about the worst things and didn't click with my therapist. I'm thinking about trying a new person, but its so daunting, yet I'm at a point where if I don't I will kill myself.

Im still figuring out how, and I hate myself for leaving my poor family so broken hearted. At least I won’t be a financial burden anymore.

I want to leave so badly, and so many things have piled up and I just wanna slip away.

1pq29vq,"I don’t want to go back on antidepressants, but I really struggle to cope with my lows.","I first went on antidepressants (Prozac) around I want to say 2021? I was in my first year of high school and had been struggling bad for months at that point (COVID obviously didn’t help) and cognitive behavioural therapy just wasn’t helpful. I got put on a relatively low dose of Prozac which did help alleviate it to an extent, and a year or so later I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD, which also explained some things and medicating for ADHD helped with some other struggles, but I still struggled with depression throughout high school and remained on Prozac with only some minor dose increases. I was very withdrawn socially and struggled with the rigorous program I was in but managed to pretend I felt better then I did most of the time, but it was just not a good time for me. 

Then the summer after I graduated I started a summer job and it was amazing. I’m not going to be too specific because it is a very specific job and place and I don’t want to dox myself, but I got to do incredibly cool things, I found out I had a passion for history, and the job had such an amazing community in and outside of work and for the first time in forever I’d made a bunch of great friends. I’m not kidding when I say it was the happiest I’d been in years, and I felt like I had a purpose, like I was part of an amazing group, and that I’d really found a passion I loved, so when summer ended even though I went off to another town for university without them and kind of struggled to make friends still I thought I was doing pretty well and wanted to try life without antidepressants for the first time in years so decided to stop my antidepressants on my own. I’m not recommending it or anything, just saying what I did, and didn’t really have much issue with withdrawal surprisingly and continued to do pretty okay for the rest of the semester. 

The next semester was not okay, and I became really depressed again to the point where I struggled to leave my dorm room to go eat for days at a time. I tried a few times to restart my antidepressants (since I still had lots left) but everytime I did they gave me horrible anxiety and so I gave up on them. Again, I’m not saying  this was a good choice, it’s just what I did. Things got a bit better when I got into a relationship (that ended a few months later but for other reasons and didn’t really affect me too badly), but the semester sucked and I was miserable. Then I went back home for the summer and back to that job and it was like a switch flipped. It was even better this time, I felt like I had access to an even better range of positive emotion now that I was off Prozac, and I was genuinely the happiest I’ve ever been. But while I love what I study and it didn’t get as bad as it did last year this past semester was really rough as well and while not to the same extent, I did have some days where it was too much to properly feed myself etc. 

I just feel kind of at a loss for what to do because I think it’s clear to me that my depression is so situation/environment dependent now and I don’t want to lose out some of the positive emotion I can feel now in exchange for marginally less depression, especially in the summers when I straight up don’t need antidepressants, and I don’t want to deal with a cycle of weaning on and off of them yearly. But at the same time I do struggle during the school year so much with my mental health, and it sucks, even though I have access to counselling through the school and stuff which helps a bit. It also probably doesn’t help that while I’m trying and made a bit of progress making a few friends this semester my social life during the school year is pretty nonexistent when it’s so good during the summer. There isn’t really anyone I’d consider a close friend yet where I go to university. And my autism makes it so much harder on that front, and my ADHD compounds with depression when it comes to my ability to function well. I just don’t know how to make things better for myself in the short term so I don’t crater during each semester when counselling only helps a bit and I don’t want to go back on meds.

1pq1elx,How can I support my depressed friend through text messages?,"I'm 28F, he's 32M. I'd actually say that we reached a point where we were more than just friends, but it suddenly stopped when he got ill. Please note that I know he's not quiet because of ghosting or ""cheating"". I know that this is a matter of mental health.

We live in different cities. He suddenly went silent in early August with a few sporadic messages here and there, wondering how I'm doing and at even asked if we could talk the next day as he thought it would be nice. That never happened, but he became socially active again a few weeks ago with constant messaging and phone calls, only to get silent again.

I don't exactly know how he works when he's depressed. We both struggle in our own ways but we've never really discussed our needs in those times. He's explained that he has a very limited social battery, just want to forget things and is just ""off"" compared to how I know him otherwise. He's also confirmed that it has nothing to do with me/us and that we're fine.

I've sent him uplifting messages, written about my day, said how I wish I could take care of him and talked about memories we've shared. I don't want to be pushy, so I text him once or twice a week. He's said before that he appreciated reading those messages.

1ppv6rm,Does anyone else do this? Is this common? (SERIOUS TW!),"I will be mentioning grape ⚠️‼️ here. Please do not read if you have the potential to be triggered, even the smallest one. 

I'm honestly curious if this is a universal experience or another bizarre manifestation of my depression/PTSD. 

Have any of you just been drinking something, literally anything: Water, milk, smoothie, soda - And without really any real reason, you just pour it over your head? Not even suddenly, but slowly, robotically, like your making yourself some sort of human Water fountain. 

I used to do this often, following a traumatic incident at 13 (I was exposed to a severely gruesome and detailed form of child grape, torture, and abuse). I had been surfing AO3 for years had never even once glanced at the tags. I'd click naively based off title, assuming it wouldn't be something so fucking disgusting and devestating. Something so evil, I'd think I would rather die than meet the person who wrote that. 

This was during COVID, where my mom was an abusive, and manipulate narcissist and told me suicidal ideation to the degree of planning and note writing was a typical and permanent stage of life I needed to get used to. I wasn't given any chance to process what I saw, internally or externally. My mom would have blamed me, attacked me, and used it to ""justify"" her abuse. I couldn't come to terms with what I saw. I just couldn't. I was so young, I saw...it and it just fucking went beyond imprinting itself behind my eyelids. It tried to erase itself completely, and me with it. 

I started having pervasive bouts of feeling completely and utterly detached from my skin and flesh to the point I couldn't tell what was my body and what was the rest of the world. I could barely understand whether I was the human or I was the chair. I was unable to feel physically or emotionally present in any way, which only worsened the depression.

I can't remember my 7th or 8th year of middle school. The only remarkable memory was when a couple girls told me about a rumor that was going on about me. I was actually elated, because I had forgotten I had existed until they reminded me that I can at least exist in other people's heads. That was the most alive I had felt in a while. 

I really can't explain wanting to pour something over my head. It was just something I did, and occasionally still do. And even when I don't, it's like my entire being is pulled to do it. For some reason, whatever reason, I feel like other people have done this as well? Maybe even for the same reason? I don't know. It'd be nice to find someone who did or does. It'd let me know this feeling of physical absence is not just a personal experience. Maybe it can even get better.

I’m  20M. And I’ve always realized since I was a little kid that I might not have a place in a world like this. Since I was a little kid I’ve been bullied in school, I used to be open and stuff, but after others constantly belittling you, you stop and become closed, to protect yourself. I ruined my mother’s income (she had a home afternoon daycare for kids), I know I was just a kid, but that has hunted me for years. I can’t stop thinking about it. I also recently went out of a one year relationship, and I felt absolutely nothing. Devoid of any emotions. I yesterday caused a car accident which damaged my own car (only a broken headlight and a bumper), and damaged slightly another person’s car, it’s been crushing me inside. Even when I made the crash, nothing seemed real, like I was watching myself from third person. I think this was the final trigger, I had thought of ODing on random pills, but after researching I decided not to. I genuinely feel nothing anymore, since I was a little kid I don’t think there was a single moment where I 100% thought to myself “damn it, I’m proud of myself”. But I think that everything is crushing my soul all at once, and the pain is becoming unbearable, I already work in a job where I interact with others, but even there, I feel nothing. Like a husk, like my body is alive but my soul ain’t. I’m genuinely losing myself every single day. 

Now I know my pain is nothing compared to others, that have actual suffering in their lives. But I do not post here to ask for pity or stuff. I just rant here because I’ve got no one to share this with. And I hope someone reads this and can relate, because in the end we’re in this together, somewhat..

1ppurwb,No chance to begin again,"An overwhelming sense of unease of not wanting to begin again after having my life end again and again 

The amount of times I have to go out and convince people, myself and everything around me that it’s worth it. That I am worth it. The amount of times people have told me they loved me but walked out with no explanation.

The amount of times you have to push yourself to be better in the hopes you make life worth living again? But what’s the point???

No pain is worth it, it’s not getting better and it’s getting worst. I can’t help but feel like I deserve it and I do know I don’t deserve a good life. I don’t deserve life and there’s nothing I can do about it.

I’ve done it all; the doctors, the therapies, the hobbies, the parties and it’s not enough. There’s no point because people , life and everything always proves that my life has no point 

Everyone has showed and told me that my life would be better without me and I agree , my life would be better without myself and I can’t even think of any reason why not to.

1pq0aq6,"Something is rotting inside of me I have to find it, and cut it out","Nothing hurts more than your soul wanting a new life, a fresh start, but your mind doesn't believe you're capable of doing it.

I think I've just been lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling for more than an hour now. I don't even remember when I woke up from my never-ending attempt of fixing my sleep schedule. I woke up to a finished Cigarettes After Sex playlist. And I was just there... staring at the ceiling, with a heaviness in my chest I couldn't name.

I was trying to get myself to cry. To lift even an iota of heaviness.

But I couldn't.

I even put on the songs that I usually listen to when I am in this state, to invoke any emotions, anything at all.

*Something is rotting inside of me*   
*I have to find it, and cut it out*

I have this song on repeat. This part of the song, cut out, put on perfect loop, so it plays like a never-ending song.

I'm trying. Trying to feel something. And finally, the tears came pouring in.

I felt a slight panic. I was getting all choked up on my tears. And my mind was frantically looking for someone to reach out to.

I just need to share a little of this burden that I'm feeling, carrying right now.

Jenny? Kris? Luisito?

My friend who left for Prague a year ago?

My friend who has been in Finland for three years now?

The void? I don't want the void right now. I need to hear a different voice. Any voice aside from the thousands of voices in my head clamoring to be heard.

It's too noisy.

But what do I tell these people if I do try to reach out?

That I'm drowning in my own doing?

The panic slowly died down, and loneliness completely washed me.

This is my fault. All my fault.

I don't have anyone to run to because I trust no one can handle me, can handle any of this. I don't allow them to prove me that they can. They have always checked in on me, asking if I'm still in the dark place, saying if I need them I can always talk to them.

This self-fulfilling prophecy... that no one can ever handle me. I don't know. It's all my fault.

I can't run to anyone. I won't run to anyone. So here I am... just running to my journal. Writing whatever Trying to wring out whatever I can to feel some sort of relief.

*Something is rotting inside of me*   
*I have to find it, and cut it out*

I don't want to do this anymore.

I really don't want to think.

I want to be anywhere else but here.

I'm so tired of staring at the same ceiling.

I don't want to be in this room anymore. I don't want anything.

Does this thing even make sense? Probably not.

I'm just writing whatever I can. Whatever words, phrases, sentences come to mind Just to feel some sort of catharsis.

I don't think it's working.

When I say friends, I genuinely don't have even one irl friend. Surely I chat with people online sometimes but somehow all drift away with time. People usually don't want to be friends with someone who's constantly depressed and I understand why so but still it's very lonely, I mean why do I have to go through something like this in my late teenage and now even adulthood. People say loneliness is great, it's true that depressed people don't want to be around people because it is sometimes suffocating and feels like too much work and overthinking and stuff but loneliness isn't great like people with normal life romanticize. I mean I'm not perfect, I have my negative traits but why is me having depression making me feel so bad about my own existence.

1ppp4v0,Realised i have to stop spending to improve my health,"So, given that my life is worthless and i am just waiting until the end of my life, i realised that spending on things like good quality food, gym etc... is wasteful. What i need to do now is to eat as cheaply as possible. Unfortunately i am not one of those whose depression prevents eating, but instead i comfort eat. So i hereby declare that I am fully committed to not spending on social activities like gym or anything else (i have no friends anyway) and eating mostly potatoes, rice, spaghetti and bread. All day, everyday. Ill stay away from meat, fruits unless they are dirt cheap like bananas. I'll have some cheap sauces or even just salt and pepper for flavouring, but mostly it'll just be that to ensure i dont waste money on myself. If i see someone throw some food in a bin like a half eaten sandwich i will wait until they have gone and eat only the clean parts. 

  
I also have some nice (kinda) clothes in my wardrobe which ill sell. I commit to only wearing cheap clothes, second hand would be best. 

  
There is no point spending anything more. My aim is to save as much money as i can for my family to enjoy, especially after im gone. I want them to celebrate their lives. I also want a free funeral for when i go. This would be a cremation, but if its one where they wait until they have enough bodies (homeless etc) and cremate all together and just dump away somewhere ill take it.

1ppxcb2,Struggling to find motivation,"Hello, I’m 28M, and have been struggling with intense depression/anxiety for the past 2 years. I’m married, have a dog, I’m in therapy, have a traumatic/nonexistent relationship with my family, and I heavily smoke weed.

Right now it’s a struggle to do anything. Even basic things are challenging like work, eating, socializing, and the quality that I’m doing those things is pretty abysmal. My work performance is bare minimum, my eating has me on a fine line between underweight and needing hospitalization, and socially I barely go outside and when I do I don’t speak.

Now, even though I’m doing all of these things really poorly, I’m still able to do them, so that’s good at least.

My main issue though, is that I feel like I have zero motivation for anything. I have no reason to get up in the morning. I just feel completely empty and devoid of meaning.

Yeah sure I will work, to get money, so I don’t have to sleep outside. Yeah sure I’ll eat food, so I don’t end up hospitalized. Yeah sure I’ll go to grad school, to get a better job, to keep being sad in my home.

Idk. I guess I’m able to function, although at a severely reduced capacity.

But every single day I just feel emptiness. I’ve always have very nihilistic views on life since I was a kid, but I guess I always hoped I was wrong. The only time I’ve ever felt good is when I was distracted enough. But I’ve just came to this point where I don’t get it, do I just need to distract myself and pretend this all makes complete sense? Like that’s crazy man, and I’ve done it, and it doesn’t last forever and when you come out on the other side that original problem is always worse because all you did was ignore it. Maybe I’m wrong idk.

I just don’t see a point. At 19 I got really into philosophy, psychology, and psychedelics, and tried to make sense of life as much as I could. At 21 I told myself the best answer I’m getting is just trying to live life to the fullest is the only point of life. And I tried to do that.

But now at 28, after a lot of hard years, I’ve found myself at the same place I was as a 10 year old kid. What’s the point? If there’s no point, and the point is just to live life to the fullest, and that life is full of hells, then what’s the point? Even if my life was incredible with no problems, if there ever was a day where I wasn’t distracted, I think I’d very likely have these same thoughts, because my concern that life is pointless has been with me since childhood.",1,0,2025-12-18 23:24:51,One_Egg_9177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppxcb2/struggling_to_find_motivation/,depression,1.0,,-0.8859,0.10824383949383949,-0.8762751817703247,1,-0.6822588229863944,-1

I have to do something. 


 I really struggle getting up in the morning, and taking care of my hygiene. I feel like I'm mean to everyone because I'm miserable. There's so much happening in my day to day life. I just feel like I'm at a loss. I cant afford therapy even if I wanted to. I just feel completely burnt out. I feel like I have been fighting this fight alone, with no weapons for so long. I'm just ready to give up. 


I feel bad for the people who are close to me, because I am just making their lives harder. I feel horrible for my husband. No one deserves to have a wife who sucks the life out of them.

1ppo257,Unbearable Suffering,"My life is falling apart. I lost the love of life right in front of me. He let his depression win and now, our marriage is done. And my kids are being affected. We are moving back to our home state but the pain is so unbearable. From being so in love, then the moment we had children, I turned into this bag for him to write paragraphs after paragraphs of how HE is hurt more, how therapy won’t work, and pills make you numb… but he tells me I’m needing to be a full time mom and have a full time job. How I need to be skinnier, and healthier, to demanding an open marriage. “You’ll make it past this” is what I hear but I’m being dragged down by his depression. I can’t breathe. I don’t know if I even want to breathe again. I sound stupid. But we spent over 20 years of being together and I’m only 33. It hurts. It hurts so much. He was my person. And now I know he doesn’t care. He just finds more fault in things wrong with me than admit he is the problem. He’s turned evil and I’m putting it lightly. Even if he solved his depression, the pain he inflicted is too great. I want to breathe, I want to disappear. It hurts. Sometimes I just want to get in the car and be at a stop light when the other traffic is going… and pull my foot off the break and end it. That’s how far I’m getting down the hole.

1pput1k,Done Nothing for 2 Yrs,"The title says it all really, for 2 yrs now all I've done is sit at my computer trying to distract myself from my thoughts. The only thing I managed to do was workout, take meds and more recently go to therapy (which is ending soon).

I got made redundant 2 yrs ago now, the job was terrible, but it at least gave me something. Since then I've barely applied for stuff. I worry it was the last straw that truly broke me beyond repair. Which is kind of weird seeing as it's not even the worst thing that's happened to me the last 10 yrs.

I was in an abusive relationship that ruined uni and most of my 20s from 2014 till late 2019. As you can imagine a lot of emotional damage was done. Couple that with a friend that made the abuse worse. Crappy jobs and a redundancy despite earning my degree in difficult circumstances. I was beyond broken by the time I moved back home to try and repair my life. Which comes with its own challenges given the nature of my parents relationship, and one of parents mental health issues, which has always been an issue.

I got therapy for a while, COVID happened a mere month or two after leaving the abusive relationship, great timing of course. I managed to very slowly get a little better and got a few jobs nothing good and only temp. Finally I got something still rubbish but it wasn't temp and after a good 7 - 8 months when I'm starting to feel a little better, the whole team was let go. Another moment of being brushed aside. I tried, albeit failed to find something better for a time. But I couldn't do it. So I closed myself off and told myself you gave it everything you had and just gave up. 

the last 5 - 6 months I found some free therapy aimed at men who have been in abusive relationships. but unfortunately it's ending in the next month. I've not made progress really, there was a major downturn in my parents own mental health which took a lot of me. thankfully they are better now, but it comes and goes. But that's no excuse. I just can't take any steps forward anymore. I've been ushed back too many times, failed too many times, punished for being me, punished for wanting a life for myself.

But more than anything is just the realisation this is it. this is my life. The sacrifices I made, the choice to work hard in very challenging times, to work instead of take the easy way out lead me to this future which I live in now. People around me have made a live for themselves, have friends, careers, families. I have nothing, I feel nothing, I desire, want or dream of nothing.

1ppul60,a sad heart,"I’ve been suffering with depression since 2018, it became more prevalent as I had gotten the IUD. I have had it removed but I still have the symptoms. Insomnia, trichotillomania, depression, anxiety and recently diagnosed with ADHD. I’ve been taking my meds daily as recommended but have been reaching for my Ativan a little bit more than usual this week. It was heavily triggered on Sunday, when I was ghosted by someone that I assumed we had a connection going and had plans to meet once we were on holidays seeing as we both work in education. He ended up cutting back in the convos and then just ended up ghosting me. Not replying or even just looking at my messages. It was frustrating because you would think a 33yr old guy with his education degree and working on another would be able to communicate well. I ended up just telling him that I hope he finds what he’s looking for and that ghosting was so “cool” and I removed him. I didn’t block him, I just removed him from my socials and I didn’t have his number saved so I just deleted the convo. It had me questioning everything about myself. Like why do I invest so much time in someone and they end up leaving or ghosting. I’ve been single for so long and I think it’s a me thing. Though I’m not sure what it is about me that makes people or guys manly, just end up leaving. My first thought is initially my weight, I’m 5’4 and weigh around 220 and actively losing weight. I’m shy but I empathize and sympathize with people, I care about people who tell me their stories because it’s just who I am. I do work in a counseling position, so I have a good concept on mental health and topics about healthy living and such. I’m aware of my depression and I do try to get myself out of it before I end up doing self harm. I’m aware of what might happen if I were to kill myself and I end up surviving. I just wish I could disappear without having anyone remember me. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life, and I feel like I’m going to be alone forever. I’ve come to peace with being alone, I go out and eat alone, I go to movies and I travel. I do what I want to do, but at the end of the day I just want to connect with someone and share my life with someone. I’m lonely and I’m not settling for less than I deserve, but then again, I just don’t have confidence in myself anymore because of the amount of dudes that don’t stay, they end up ghosting, distancing themselves and just discontinuing the conversations without any reason or why. I just came here to vent. I’m just ruminating these consistent things and making myself sad in the process, but yet again I know I shouldn’t think those thoughts bc it makes me sad and I should be over it by now.

1ppu8u1,what is wrong with me.,"I can’t even explain properly what I feel, and I’m not sure exactly what’s wrong with me.

I don’t have any friends anymore, which honestly sucks a lot. I have my parents, but they aren’t very supportive, and I have a younger sibling I can’t talk to. It feels like I don’t really have anyone.

I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I still go to work and I’m studying in university, but university is on holiday right now. Even so, before every work shift I end up crying at the thought of social interactions and just being outside my room. When my parents try to get me to go out of the house, I don’t want to at all. I cancel plans with my ex-friends because when the time comes, I genuinely can’t make myself go. I don’t know if I’m just lazy, but it feels more like I just can’t be bothered with life anymore.

I wake up every day hating how I look. I can tell I’m getting worse because I’ve resorted to self-harm. When I’m nervous or overthinking, it somehow makes everything go quiet for a little while. I have so many things I need to do, and I *know* I need to do them, but I keep putting them off until the last minute. Then I rush, pull all-nighters, and exhaust myself even more.

The problem is that I don’t want to get help. It feels too embarrassing, and I don’t believe anything anyone says would make me decide to talk to someone. It feels like this is something I have to deal with alone.

And honestly, without this daily struggle, who even am I? If I feel better, what would I be? I’d still have no friends. So I guess feeling this way is okay because at least it makes me feel *something* instead of nothing. I don’t know. I just have a lot of dark thoughts, and I don’t know how to control them.

A part of me also believes I might be lying to myself, or exaggerating how I really feel. I keep wondering if I actually don’t feel anything at all and my brain is just convincing me that I do. Sometimes it feels impossible to trust my own thoughts or emotions, like I don’t know what’s real anymore.",1,0,2025-12-18 21:23:43,anikinskywalk3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppu8u1/what_is_wrong_with_me/,depression,1.0,,-0.3455,0.09742063492063495,-0.8899403214454651,1,-0.5291360337386055,-1

1ppkyoh,This is gonna be a long one,"I’m just posting this here because I don’t know where else to go. Buckle up, or don’t! I just feel so lost and crushed currently. Gonna try to make this long story short. 

30m from the US. 5 year old daughter. Me and her mother split a little over a year and a half ago. I haven’t felt right since then, granted being with her was worse. I think I’m mourning the loss of what I imagined our family would be like and will never be. I accepted that wouldn’t be a reality before our child even hit a year old. Regardless. Her and my daughter ended up moving out this time last year. Since then I’ve had her on weekends and see her throughout the week. This is massive pain/change #1

I was progressively going more and more into debt as she was a SAHM, and the debt somehow just got worse after she moved out. 

3 months ago I lost my job. Despite my best efforts, I still haven’t been able to get another. I ended up having to move out of my apartment and back to my parents. That experience was gut wrenching. I had lived there for 5 years, the first place to call my own. My daughter’s first home and where she spent her first years of her life. I had the first heartbreak of moving some of her stuff out once, then the second time for good. 

Well it’s been a month back at my parents, still no job. Bank is negative $150. I owe almost $1000 in bills from old apartment still. Credit card companies calling me every 10 minutes. Rejected job application after another. 

The one thing I’ve been good at, had success at etc. has been music. Even the state of that has me incredibly discouraged. I don’t even have the strength to make art for myself anymore. 

I now spend my days with crippling financial anxiety and stress, applying for jobs with no luck (ex accountant btw), thinking about the heartbreaking comments my child makes, no friends check up on me, nothing. 

I feel so fucking lost, useless, sad, hopeless. And I barely scratched the surface.

1ppsoun,"The phrase ""I Know a General""","Here’s a tailored version of your text for a Reddit post, with adjustments for platform readability, tone, and audience engagement.

---

When your family retakes the living room after decades of silent occupation, there’s something wrongfully right about finally stopping the pretense. Eventually, the sperm-donor-in-chief pulls the concept of “protection” out of the shared-blood contract of your childhood.

Another failure of the patriarchate. Did it fail miserably? Absolutely—with extra terror.

Every child pays a psychological tax to boot “immediate threat” from their developmental landscape. But sometimes, the turncoat is the father himself.

You become one of the walking damned.

After the Puberty Civil Wars of the early 2010s, the bully’s dominance sparked a paternal decision so mundane in its failure: they teach you to expect sanctuary, then abandon you when the siege begins.

---

Imagine a safe mind.  Without panic, betraying kin, or the foreign force of your own screaming nervous system.

That reality evaporated for me early. I worked full-time as ‘Son’ during my lifelong semester break from sanity. I’ve studied betrayal dynamics—specifically, how an institution (biologically speaking) evolves to handle a father’s approach toward undefended territory: me.

It’s not like imagining your dad and a functional parent kissing after breaking the Curse of Generational Cowardice, coincidentally involving the Gelael Group’s KFC franchise expansion in Indonesia in the 1980s.

Which led to my dream of having a Father in the Emotional Sahara.

---

My bad habit? Expecting safety.

A Father in the Emotional Sahara only existed from the Jurassic epoch of idealized TV to the Late Pliocene, right before the first hominid thought, “I’ll just bluff instead.”

---

Let’s get academic. Feeling it is too much like surrender.

The foundational text isn’t Freud. It’s Orwell, performed by a middle-aged man with the strategic depth of a puddle.

The Ministry of Truth announces: “We are protected.”

The telescreen in the living room blares: “I have connections.”

You look at the boot on your neck—placed there by the son of a local authority—and then at the man who provided 50% of your DNA. He leans in, smelling of cheap coffee and compromised integrity. He doesn’t move the boot. Doesn’t call anyone. He offers a factoid:


> “I know General A.”

Let’s autopsy that sentence.

* Subject: (I). The ego.  
* Verb: (Know). Not “will confront.” Not “have called.” Know. A passive cognitive state.  
* Object: General A. A token. A chip for the bargaining table of your terror.

It’s a masterpiece of impotence. It mistakes acquaintance for action, name-dropping for power-wielding. It’s the linguistic equivalent of watching your house burn and saying, “I have the phone number for water.”

Peak fatherless behavior.

His own parents saw the void where paternal instinct should’ve been. You’re not the accuser—you’re the notary, stamping ""VERIFIED: EMPTY” on the document of genetic continuity.

This is the Geopolitics of the Nursery. You were a small, unaligned state whose sovereignty was violated. You appealed to your security guarantor—the superpower that signed the...Biological Treaty of Unconditional Defense—and it issued a press release. A weak one.

The insurgency in your mind—the rage, the violent fantasies—was inevitable. When the central government fails, warlords rise.

---

**A brief interlude on bullies, or, The Sons of Authorities**

Bullies are entropy with a face. But the sons of authorities? They’re **impunity incarnate.** Their power is derivative, like a bad sequel, but no less real.

To be bullied by them isn’t a fight—it’s a **demonstration.** You’re the proving ground for their inherited power. And when your own father witnesses this public debriding of his paternal authority and responds with a cocktail-party anecdote? You don’t just feel unsafe. You feel **unreal.**

Your pain becomes epistemologically suspect. If the man meant to validate your reality instead offers a non-sequitur about a general, then what is your screaming nervous system? A hallucination? A *faux pas*?

You become a **thoughtcriminal** in your own home.

---

**The Professional Help Paradox**

So you go to therapy. You sit in the slightly-too-soft chair and begin the debrief. You’re not crying—you’re **filing a report.**

The therapist, trained for *emotion*, gets a **forensic audit of a soul.** They flinch. You see it.

You explain the violent fantasies not as outbursts, but as **logistical plans**—Special Operations drafted in the absence of a functioning central command.

You watch their eyes. The flicker isn’t fear *for* you—it’s dread *of* you. You’re not a client; you’re a **biohazard.**

So you learn the final skill: **Therapeutic Impersonation.** You perform “healing” for them. You become the good, broken thing they can fix, so they don’t have to gaze into the silent vacuum your father left.

---

**The Sardonic Sanctuary**

They tell you to build a “safe space.” You can’t build safe in an active war zone, and your skull is Fallujah, circa 2004.

So you build **absurd.** You build **impossible.**

You don’t imagine a happy family—that’s too close, a trapdoor back into pain.  
You imagine **Jake Cronenworth and TWICE’s Nayeon kissing after breaking the Hanshin Tigers’ Curse of the Colonel.**

A San Diego Padres infielder and a K-pop idol, tied to a Japanese baseball superstition about a Colonel Sanders statue, linked to the Indonesian franchise expansion of KFC in the 1980s by the Gelael Group.

This fantasy is a **fortress.** No trauma can get in because the drawbridge is made of pure *non sequitur*. You’re taking the chaotic energy of your pain and forcing it to write alternative-history fanfic about fast-food geopolitics.

It’s your **Rainforest in the Sahara.** A biome sustained by defiant imagination—a middle finger to the barren wasteland you were handed.

---

**Conclusion**

All rights reserved? The right to sanity was revoked without notice.  
All fights deserved? The one fight you needed fought was spectated by a coward with a roster of contacts.

Some of us weren’t raised. We were **stationed** with a biological relative who confused paternity with branding.

Our foundational trauma isn’t an event—it’s a **negation.** The sound of a promise being deleted before it was ever spoken.

The violent fantasies are the un-built architecture of the justice we were owed.  
The daydreams are the sovereign nation we built in exile.  
The sardonic tone is the only language left that doesn’t feel like a lie.

*“Saya tau jenderal A”* isn’t a sentence. It’s a **monument.** A headstone for the father that never was. My only remaining duty is to visit occasionally and practice my graffiti.

Bozo. Peak fatherless behaviour.

I didn’t write that. The truth did. I just have the high EQ, and the low expectations, to quote it directly.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go water my Sahara Rainforest. It’s thriving, against all known laws of nature.

Just like me.

So… that’s my geopolitical situation. How about you?",1,0,2025-12-18 20:20:25,Felix_Aznable,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppsoun/the_phrase_i_know_a_general/,depression,1.0,,-0.9969,-0.030267507002801113,0.0,-1,-0.3051235014005602,-1

Sometimes I just wanna scream or cry, but I sit there, silent, hoping nobody notices. Even things I used to love feel… flat. Music, hobbies, even hanging out with people—it’s all just background noise.

I know I’m not alone, right? There’s gotta be someone else scrolling through their phone, pretending everything’s fine while feeling completely empty inside.

1ppknaz,This entire year felt like such a waste,"This is my first post in this sub reddit, I’m just so frustrated with everything. Honestly I feel so bad even talking about this on here because I know others have much more difficult circumstances than I do. I kind of just need to let it all out though. 

It’s the end of the semester of my 2nd year of college. I have a final tomorrow that I don’t even plan on going to because I’m going to fail the course anyway. I feel so hopeless and crappy about everything, I’m doing so poorly in school and I haven’t had a job for months. Luckily I live with my family so I have a roof over my head which I am very grateful for but I have a poor relationship with them. I’m broke as shit right now and I’m genuinely so stressed out about that it’s so difficult to get a job I’ve been applying everywhere. I’m only 19 years old but I’m so exhausted by everything already. I don’t  understand how people keep going it’s all so tiring. I have unmedicated ADHD and it’s been making my life all the more difficult. Everything is so hard and overwhelming and I wish this period of my life was over. 

I hate being so negative about everything but I’m genuinely so hopeless. I want to believe that things will get better and everything is temporary both good and bad but I’ve been doing so bad mentally the entirety of 2025. I feel like I’ve just regressed in so many areas of my life and I’m so disappointed in myself. Thank you to anyone that read this. I hope things get better not just for myself but for everyone

It’s been a month since then and I haven’t done anything. I’m in a foreign country. My visa will expire and then I’ll have to move out. I have no direction or plan for the future. I lie in my bed the whole day unable to do anything. My friends and colleagues are trying to help me but I can’t accept their help due to jealousy. My only friend group in this country are my colleagues and it makes it hard for me to take their help. They are still working and thriving at the place which kicked me out. So when they try to show sympathy and understanding it stings like hell. I feel like a hungry animal waiting for them to feed me scraps.

Same goes for my other friends also. They all are in great companies in high paying roles. I feel so small talking with them. They will never relate to my situation and this makes me realise how badly I have failed.

I have stopped applying for new roles and I have stopped taking referrals. I see referrals as charity from my successful friends and it hurts like hell to take them. I am feeling numb in a foreign country with no sense of direction. 

I tried talking with a therapist but he blamed everything on me saying that I was clearly not as good as my colleagues. While this is true it hurt me and I haven’t returned to him since.

1pp4q70,I am getting fired from the only thing that made me happy,"Tw// sexual assault, addiction

I graduated college and moved to a different state and I was so excited because I got a job in the field I studied- which was hard to get  because it’s a very niche creative industry.

I also had a lot of bad experiences with my family- my dad is an addict and my mom and I use to fight to the extent where I got hit

So I saw this as an opportunity to be someone outside of that 

I made a lot of mistakes at first because the job was harder than I expected. 

The first person I moved in with sexually assaulted me… I still don’t even know how I feel about calling it that but idk what else I could call it

This made me pretty depressed esp because they also ended up being an addict which was triggering for me, breaking the lease was nearly impossible.

during this time I made more mistakes. I felt terrible and my coworkers started to dislike me and ofc I understood. I was sat down one day and told that I would have to be let go if I didn’t improve and was put on a probation plan.

I finally got to move out, I started taking medication to help me focus and help with how depressed I got.

I was by my manager that I was really improving and I felt so good about the work I was doing and I was really making connections that mattered so much to me with the people I worked with. Especially as I got more into teaching.

I forgot to do something routine recently, it involves logging hours.. I was nervous about it but my manager told me that even she forgot sometimes and that it should be okay…, but my boss / the owner of the business was under a lot of stress and this made her really frustrated.

We had a lot of tension. But my manager said I was doing really well still. 

A couple weeks later I emailed the owner asking for an updated meeting about the probation because I hadn’t heard anything in a month about it.

She replied back in a way that made me feel nervous. Just very straightforward and trying to have the meeting asap.

When I went to work recently, I saw a note left next to the computer that basically confirmed that I was going to be fired.

I was not expecting this at all, specifically because my manager and the owner met regularly and discussed my probation and my manager had been telling me that she felt like I was doing super well.

I’ve been working and trying to act like I don’t know but it’s like my life is falling apart.

Like i said this is a very niche small community of work, and the owner is well known and respected.

So it feels like I might not be able to even get another job like this ever again, I’m speaking like a child right now but I’m just super upset.

I don’t have a support system, I don’t have friends here outside of my job… this was everything to me this is all I have 

Idk if I’m conveying well at all how hurtful this is for me. I keep crying.

I was finally feeling happy and like I believed in my future. I have no idea what to do.

The holidays are also already upsetting for me because I go home, I’ve been trying to repair my relationship with my mom and it’s going well but It’s still hard for me to come back. 

This job was starting to give me the sense that I had something like a family.. my manager and my coworker even told me that they loved me and wanted me to open up more or something like that.

I’m not going to meet with my boss until January. 

My eyes are constantly puffy because I can’t stop crying I feel like I ruined everything I’ve basically put six years of work into this between my degree and working..and I feel like it’s just gone now

1ppmo46,This year will haunt me for what feels like forever,"I’m literally a perfect example of the saying “ a fool in his money are soon parted”

I can’t even count the amount of times I fucked up this year basically over the same problem every time. I’m an addict that cant let go of his drug of choice. If you care to know more, it’s basically time-lined all over my profile.

Some days I wonder if I like my misery since I keep digging myself in a deeper hole in life. The obvious answer is just that it’s easier to keep going back to the addiction instead of getting my life back in order. 

I’ve already done the math what I’m making per year. It’ll take me almost 3 years minimum to get back to where I once was that’s assuming I completely cut every negative habit I’ve picked up this year. I can’t fully say I’ve learned my lesson since I don’t cut the main source to my discipline going out the window. 

I wonder if I’ll ever be a good kid to my mom. A good brother to my siblings. I’m the worst role model you can have. 21 and everything is in shatters. Nothing feels rewarding anymore.  Nothing excites me the way the negative stuff does. I’m without purpose. Just a selfish prick. Stuck in this world feeling like I’m inadequate in every aspect of life. I can only fake the sanity for so long. I’m not okay. I don’t know if I ever will be. The joys of life seem unattainable. 

2025 will go down as one of the shittiest years of my life. The worst part is I feel I can’t reach out and tell anyone in person. This is all held in. I’ll never show what I don’t want to be seen.

People say I am nice what they dont realize is that I have no other option, I cant be not nice, I dont have the brains and guts to be that.

Even the people I used to call friends dont talk with me, and nobody want me to be arround. I am over as human being. 

If I lived in some previous age I would have been dead by now, I have utterly zero contribution towards society, humankind or work or friends or family, all would have been better of without me. 

My life is not even worth ending, its just a constant disappointment on the world. 

I have embraced the failure I am, I will still cry when I surely hurt the people I love ,which I will again and again because I am such a failure but I can't do anything about it, I cant go against god now can I.",2,1,2025-12-18 14:50:57,patito-potato,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppmjie/if_my_father_had_raised_some_other_boy_he_would/,depression,1.0,,-0.6875,0.008712121212121206,-0.8363417387008667,1,-0.6226784451080091,-1

1ppm7py,I feel so guilty for being depressed,"All of this year has been a nightmare, and for the last few months especially, I was struggling  with depression, suicidal thoughts ,and self harm. Through those months, I acted very mean, uninterested, and uncaring to my best friend.

My memory is spotty, but I think I had tried to communicate to my best abilities a few times, that I literally did not have the will to be energetic, so if I was coming off kind of zombie-like, it was because I truly was so mentally exhausted. It felt like I had to put on a performance every time I talked to someone. I tried my best at times, but I know I was not the best friend.

I've acknowledged this to her many times, verbally saying that i wasn't being a good friend. it makes me feel so terrible to know i had made her sad at all. I'm on antidepressants now and am starting to act more normal, but I just feel like theres a part of my side left un-communicated. I feel so guilty and horrible all the time for how i treated her. But when I think of me two months ago, I was genuinely on the last bit of will I had. I was actively planning suicide and self harming every other day. I told literally no one about how bad it had gotten for months. no friends, not her, not any family, no one.

i don't know what to do. do I just leave it all unsaid? i made a comment that i'm starting to be funny again, and thats how i know my meds are working, and she just said that she knows they're working cause i'm not mean to her anymore.

1ppp6hb,Telling my therapist I think I’m depressed when we only focus on my OCD.,"TW, SOME minor mentions of self harm and suicide (not much at all)

so for context i’m diagnosed with ocd, misophonia, and misokinesia

my school teacher knows im (passive) suicidal with no intent to act on my thoughts, but i self harmed due to the ocd, misophonia, misokinesia, AND other things which were basically all of symptoms of depression

i have a psychologist and i go to her for the misophonia ocd stuff, and on our first session, my parents were present. she asked me questions all of which i answered honestly EXCEPT when she brought up some depression traits; eg she asked me ”do you feel guilty, hopeless, helpless, sad, like a bad person, hate yourself” and i said no for each one being conscious of my parents’ presence.

my parents are aware i self harmed but not that i was suicidal, as my school didnt feel the need to share that with them. 

my parents could and would potentially be dissapointed, upset, hurt, and perhaps even angry if they found out i was suicidal or depressed.

how do i bring this up with the psychologist, who’s ONLY focusing on ocd + miso??

because i feel like if there’s something undiagnosed that could be bad too lol, but also i don’t think she’ll ask because we only focus on ocd, misophonia, and misokinesia

1ppauma,I don't want to make it past 30,"Everyday I wake up and think about dying and usually on my ride to work I think about walking into traffic or in front of a train.

I truly screwed up my life. I could've had so much. I could've gotten into my dream  college/university if I was smarter in my late teens, but I was too mentally ill and never got the right support in the right moments. I was in a university, but dropped out after my first year. Went back to college again and got a prerequisite certificate for another major program that I didn't pursue. Currently have a two year career focused diploma which is nice. I would do anything to go back in time to fix this. 

I don't have the courage to talk about this with my primary care provider. I'm scared of what might happen and I can't lose my job (although it's not the best, I do like it somewhat, I've only been there a few months). 

Every time I get stressed at work, or see someone successful I want to end it. I can't take this amount of failure. 

I have family support and no friends. No partner either. I don't eat very well or sleep very well and don't exercise. I don't see a point? What's the point when failure is all I'll ever know. 

I'm transgender, I have successfully transitioned and that's great. Pretty much the only reason I'm still here struggling. Pure sunk cost fallacy at this point. I'd rather not become another statistic, if I can help it. 

I have an appointment with a psychotherapist this Friday and I'm so scared to address my mountain of issues. I haven't had therapy in years due to the cost/lack of coverage. 

I'll be honest this used to some sort of fear to ask for help. I wanted the pity because I felt so lonely. I had a spark of hope somewhere. In my early 20s that faded and it's completely gone now.

It's always the same cycle: hope -> stagnation -> depression

  
I'll lose my job because I can't keep it together. I'll find another one. And then lose it again. It takes maybe a few months for this cycle to repeat. Why bother? I'm wasting my time and everyone else's.

Anyways I’m going to give a brief overview of my life. 1 year old: mother tried drowning me. 2 years old: went into my mother’s edibles. 4 years old: locked in my room for 2 days with no food or drink. 6 years old: almost strangled by my 16 year old brother, and my mother told me she only had me to use me as a tool against my father. 8 years old: first outpatient facility trip. 10 years old: first suicide attempt after being raped by teacher and first trip to mental hospital. 12 years old: divorce between my mother and father that lasted until I was 15. 13 years old: forced to live with my mother after my father became homeless, and was abused more, and got addicted to nicotine and became an alcoholic. 14 years old: suicide attempt 2 and moved in with my dad. 16: suicide attempt 3. And recovered from alcoholism. 17: suicide attempt 3-6. 18: fallout with my father, and planning suicide. Have a great day, and remember that drugs are bad.

1ppfdri,A lump in my throat to express this feeling.,"Hi, I'm 18 years old and eight months pregnant. Ever since I found out I was pregnant, I've been terrified, since most people are used to hearing the typical phrase, ""If you get pregnant, you're out of here.""

When I saw those two lines, all I did was cry because I knew very well what would happen if my parents found out.

My boyfriend comforted me, but in my mind was the other plan B, which was abortion. My boyfriend didn't want that, but at that moment I felt more than determined. I looked into methods; I was told that there were clinics that did it discreetly and even pills. These were recommendations I heard because I didn't want the baby. One day, my boyfriend and I went to find out how many months or weeks pregnant I was, to see if the procedure was dangerous or not. I found out I was seven weeks along. When the obstetrician had us listen to the baby's heartbeat, I burst into tears. I was discouraged from having the procedure. I just had to be strong and speak up because my birthday was coming up.

The day came when I would tell my parents. My hands trembled with fear. I couldn't stay silent any longer, and with tears in my eyes, I told my dad. I was surprised because I thought he would hit me or something. He understood. But the problem was with my mom. She started saying awful things to me, insulting me, yelling at me, which only made me more afraid. But it's worth noting that there have always been fights, beatings, and humiliations in my family, especially from my parents. I'll continue with the story.
That same day, I didn't go to work as usual. I had a feeling something was going to happen. My parents started arguing loudly; the yelling was horrible. I just cried, telling them to stop fighting. At one point, my dad pulled out a stick and tried to hit my mom. Even though my mom was talking badly about me, I threw myself on top of her so my dad would drop the stick and not hurt her. He still hit her, and some of the blows hit me.
At that moment, I said, ""This is my fault."" I blame myself for not being the daughter they wanted.

Anyway, the months went by, and I was still living at home. Every time we had a fight, my mom would say horrible things to me. She called me a bitch, dirty, sly. I ignored her. I always compared myself to my cousins, and she'd say things like, ""Why didn't I have a daughter like you?"" and so on.
Today, my baby is doing well; I'm due soon.

And my parents still can't stand each other; the fights keep getting worse.

I contracted syphilis. It was devastating news. I was with my boyfriend all this time, and I never thought I'd get infected. I'm currently undergoing treatment because it was detected early.
If anyone happens to read this, I'd just like some advice. Believe it or not, I'm still scared to this day.",5,2,2025-12-18 07:55:45,miaumiauuuuuuuuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppfdri/a_lump_in_my_throat_to_express_this_feeling/,depression,0.86,,-0.9977,-0.09791666666666668,-0.7234848141670227,-1,-0.6806357404168447,-1
1ppmy0y,I've changed but i feel the same,"I always thought that things would be more tolerable as I got older, but all that I've found is that I'm more numb than before. I go through the motions day by day but nothing seems to feel all that different; I'm still not satisfied, I'm still unhappy, I still can't relax.  
I've done so much to improve myself but I wonder if it even matters. I will fall back into old habits. I will ruin it for myself. I will not be satisfied unless I've done it all.

I'm at my happiest when I'm rude and condescending, but I still can't be like that because I know I only act that way out of ego. i wish I was kind and genuine but I'm too far gone. Nobody around me would understand me if I changed that way, I'd have to sacrifice everyone, but even then I still can't change that way. No matter what I always end up embracing the worst parts of me because that's what makes me feel like a real person. I never feel like I'm living in the moment and I'm always in the back of my head watching. At least I have alcohol and marijuana to forget about that for a while.

1ppmqne,At my Limit,"Hello everyone,  
when I read the other posts in this sub, it feels wrong to post here. My life has been privileged from the very beginning. I’m writing anyway.

My parents worked hard to build a certain standard of living. A house with a garden, once a year a vacation to a neighboring country by car. Nothing extravagant, but comfortable.

In this environment, I never really had to go without anything. I never achieved anything outstanding at school, but I didn’t do particularly badly either. Then I studied mechanical engineering and graduated with decent results. I chose a profession and have worked in it ever since. So far, nothing unusual.

I started working in 2019… then about a year and a half of professional experience, then COVID. Then my team leader decided to follow some colleagues and leave the company. In 2024, I took over his position, initially for three employees. The past two years have been hell. I was asked from all sides for organizational and technical advice. In most cases, I had to make decisions without really knowing for sure. There was little to no leadership from above. It’s also important to mention that at the beginning of 2023 our long-term data backup was wiped in a cyberattack—so I couldn’t access over 10 years of data from previous employees to see how things had been done.

These two years broke me. I wouldn’t describe my workload as excessively high. The lack of work in our industry meant I worked normal 40-hour weeks. But my mental load was much higher. And I can’t do it anymore. I’m exhausted. After 10 years of “career” (studies + job), I’m certain: I have no skills that are needed, no deep technical expertise, and no motivation left to make anything of myself. Because I’m sure I’ll fail anyway and for the Job that I wordked in these past 6 years, the Jobs are getting less and less and will most likely be replaced by AI. And just thinking about working this profession more makes my heart race and my stomach stumble. Anyways. I feel like the most useless piece of sh\*t.

My personal way of working has always been riddled with sloppiness. With carelessness. And no matter how much time I take at work and try to be thorough—there’s always something I overlook. Something missing. I have always been great in starting something and then never putting in the work to pull through. Useless.

For the past two weeks, I’ve barely been able to get out of bed. I’m in therapy, but I don’t see a way forward. I only developed hobbies that I actually enjoy in the last 2–3 years, but even from those, my lack of perspective is draining the last bit of joy. I can’t go on.

I don’t know where to go with myself or what my purpose on this planet is—and I’m starting to accept that I don’t have one. This isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way. In retrospect, the first signs were already visible 10 years ago, when I was just starting my studies. No motivation, no sense of purpose, no particular interests. Nothing. Back then, maybe there would still have been time to turn things around in a positive way.

When I look at my friends, they’ve all arrived successfully in their jobs, are starting families, etc. Was it always easy? No. Do I trust myself to get through similarly difficult times and turn things around? No. I just want to be left alone. I can’t do this anymore.",0,0,2025-12-18 15:04:29,Ok_Owl8744,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppmqne/at_my_limit/,depression,0.5,,-0.7724,0.06752329846079845,0.0,-1,-0.2182153403078403,-1
1ppdb51,My life is great. Why am I still not happy?,"I have objectively a life a lot of people wish for. I’m a college student at a top university. I have an amazing, loving, smart partner who treats me well. I have kind, funny, caring friends. I have a wonderful mom who I can always trust. I’m always told I am good looking. I have a great paying job which also treats me super well, my boss is the kindest and my company treats their workers super good. I practically should have no major worries. And yet every single day, every single hour, all I wish for is death. All I see is a pitch black void that’s swallowing me. I’m scared of life and I hate how exhausting it is. I can’t get out of this. It seems so perfect from the outside but I am still incredibly unhappy. I’m so sensitive, I see the pain in this world and I see how cruel people are. I see how many animals are dying, how many are being mistreated, I see pain everywhere, I feel pain all the time. I see children starving and civilians die due to the greed of those who control everything. I see the failures of humanity. I haven’t felt happy in months. I debate killing myself. How is that possible? Is it my anxiety, my adhd, my depression all merging into one big monster which will eventually swallow me whole?

1ppiz72,Tired,"Amazing life. Horrible mindset. Functionally capable, mentally not. Not really looking for advice or solutions, basically gave up on those long ago. Help is temporary and no advice i have ever received has changed the way i feel daytoday. The best advice to me is that which makes me feel better about the way i feel. Past acceptance, onto the never ending grind of fighting through it. Talking about it provides no relief so i dont. Hoping it gets better, expecting it not to. No clue what im looking for here, im just tired of being tired. I work as hard as anybody and i have plenty to show for it but its never ending. Figured id try something new bc the idea of mental help feels pathetic to me, but relating to ppl who somewhat understand is a good distraction. I know exactly what to do, i just dont look forward to doing it my whole life, although the alternative is far worse; it feels i never have options that call for looking forward to. Everything will always be a chore with the exception of complete distraction. Focusing on other ppl who may or not benefit from my advice or crude comprehension is as good as it gets for me, so lay it on me. Let me look at your problems from a 3rd person perspective so i spend 5 seconds not looking at my own.

1ppmhtn,I don't know why I always fall back to this state.,"I went to library today. I had earphones in my ears. Someone approached and I took out one earphone to hear him, I couldn't react and I couldn't hear clearly what he said. I thought he said if someone is sitting here, and I replied no.
But the truth was, he said if I can take this chair from here? And I denied that. He had to put his bag down because of me. Because of me he had to be uncomfortable. I couldn't forgive myself, I stop can't forgive myself. It was wierd inside me. I had a presentation to finish but I still left the library. I wonder if I would ever be able to go to library.

I knew I shouldn't have tried to go to library. Public places belong to normal people afterall. I know life moves on, and past thoughts only hurt in the long run, they worsen even what could have been better. Like I still remember when I got angry at my little brother even when he didn't do anything wrong, I was in 4th grade then. I still blame myself for that every day. My mind never forgets such things...not when someone was hurt because of me. I won't go to library now

I don't want to exist. I don't love anyone. It's not like I know what love is anyways. But that makes me ungrateful and selfish...atleast that's why my friends and roommates say. They aren't wrong, I would say the same about myself. What hurts the most is that I don't even want to change...I keep being like this hateful person who overthinks himself into depression everyday and ruins the next day. I severed all my connections now. I don't even talk to friends. I stay alone. I don't hope for anything. I don't want anyone. I had one presentation that's why I went to library to prepare ppt for it...but now I don't even care about that presentation, it can go to waste for all I care. I don't care if I get a job, a friend, a partner, a family, a house or not. I don't care. I don't care about anyone....I just want to die. Why is a person bound not to die just because he has family he/she didn't even chose",1,0,2025-12-18 14:47:57,Staggered95,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppmhtn/i_dont_know_why_i_always_fall_back_to_this_state/,depression,1.0,,-0.9931,-0.018460648148148153,0.0,-1,-0.3016221296296296,-1
1ppgca9,I’m okay.,"Except I’m not. I pretend to be. I pretend to smile. I pretend it doesn’t hurt. No one told me that at the age of 27 I would be regretting so many life choices.
The feelings of shame and worthlessness overcome my entire body. It’s hard to believe someone like me is worthy of love. Someone like me doesn’t deserve to make new memories. I know that’s not true. but that’s how it feels. There’s no one to talk to because, the damage has been done. I’ve ruined everything, and no one to blame but myself. 

I might not be okay right now, or the next week, or next month, but I believe that I will get better. Maybe next year will be better.

1ppm9w9,just some thoughts,"I am depressed. I'm so depressed my hair becomes unbrushed, my body unwashed, my teeth unclean. I feel like I have no future. No way out. I dream of being taken by an illness or a tragedy of some sort just so I don't hurt my family. I don’t know why I'm like this. The GP asked me how I'm doing and my throat gained a lump, my voice cracked, and tears welled. “I’m fine.” She didn't believe me, but I walked out before I showed how I actually felt.  I’m sick of lying. I want to be helped but I just can't help myself. I crave medication that will make me feel ok or at least take away this pain and make me a numb, hollow shell. Instead, I self-medicate. I drown myself in wine or vodka each night in an attempt to numb myself, but I just end up a sick, soppy mess, dreaming about leaving this life. I have no reason to be sad which makes this all the worse. Endless breakdowns over what? I see the concern in my mother's eyes, and it breaks me. I am a sick selfish fuck. I don’t deserve a loving family. All I do is cause hurt and worry. I take a blade to the skin my mother formed for me and scar it. No one will know how I really feel, and even if they did, they wouldn't truly care, for their life goes on. That's the thing, I feel my world is coming to an end but everyone else is living and moving. This is why I stay silent. It's my own burden, no one else's. It will stay that way forever so for now I just bury my feelings and pray one day I get better or just die.

I know that this isn’t right and this isn’t healthy and I can see how miserable I’ve become over the years, but I don’t care about fixing it. I just kinda want it to be over already. Every day I do nothing and every night all I can think about is death and the end.

1ppm523,Question,"One of the biggest issues I have had in this life, when it comes to human interactions is the constant exclamations, that always seem to take a jab at my mental health. However it always comes after someone has been cunty to me, and I've called them out on it. After being ignored, cut out, verbally reduced or gossiped about, by them I will get something like:

You see yourself so negatively, I just can’t compete with that.

You see me as such a bad person that I can't exist in your life.

I don’t have the mental strength to support you.

No one's feelings matter more than anyone else's. But we're all responsible for our own peace. 

And it's not just one person. But it's only the people that know I go to therapy, I'm a survivor of many kinds of very severe abuse. And it just seems like that becomes a scapegoat for people to be shitty.

1ppetia,Feel like a complete embarrasment,"I'm in my final year of my bachelors degree, and I need to get an internship in basically a month and a half so I can graduate. All the places I've tried applying to so far have rejected me, and I can't even blame them. I feel like I've made no effort to learn anything beyond what university threw at me, and despite getting good grades for the most part, I still suck ass at coding. The AI situation really isn't helping either.
I've been leeching off of my parents, living a comfortable life, all because they wanted me to be able to have fun, live comfortably and focus on my studies. I only have so much time left until it's revealed that I've done nothing of value during this time. I warned them that I'm a dumbass, I've tried explaining it many times, but just because I get good grades and assist friends with their studies, they never believe me and think everything will be okay.

I don't know if I can live with this embarrassment. I don't know how I will face my parents if I can't get an internship in time. It's no ones fault but my own.
And I know I'm being dramatic. I'm 22 - I could retake the year, I could even go into a whole different field, I know there are technically an infinite amount of possibilities for how to survive, but I'm not worried I won't survive.

I still live with my parents but I pay for a lot of stuff since my mom is sick and my dad also lost his job because of health issues, so I feel like I can't just quit because I need the money...

1pphe3p,endless cycle,"every time i take a step forward, my brain pushes me back again. depression usually leaves me numb, so i don’t really care about anything around me; i don’t have the will to live, but at least im “stable”. but now that i’ve started a new antidepressant, what always happens when i change medication is happening again: i start caring about life, and then i look at the situation i’m in, and i start having crises about everything. very quickly, those crises drag me back to square zero, and i feel trapped in depression again.

i understand that to regain the will to live, i need to get out of the place i’m in right now. but to be able to get out of this place, i first need to regain the will to live. it feels like an endless cycle. an impossible wall to climb.",2,0,2025-12-18 09:38:49,rosewdagger,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pphe3p/endless_cycle/,depression,1.0,,-0.7394,-0.0015091390091389971,-0.7949652671813965,-1,-0.619604461392526,-1

1ppa7xe,Been trying to get out of this over half my life,"I don't need responses. I don't need support. I just need others to know I was here, I was depressed and the programs in place to help failed me miserably and repeatedly. Not because I didn't put in all effort I had but because they do not work and there needs to be many changes. So here you go..

I finally was granted disability for my depression after 5 years of not being able to keep a job and being dysfunctionally depressed for 11 years prior. I thought this might turn things around but it has only gotten worse. I no longer hope that I will get out of this. It only gets worse. I know it will be the end of me one day and I'm coming to accept that.

I tried everything we are told to with all that I have. Then I tried all the things we are told not to, just to make sure. Nothing works. Positivity and gratitude are a load of shit just like meds and therapy. I'm glad these things work for some people but it needs to be said that it doesn't work for most people that are already depressed. 1 in 5. 20 percent. That's all it works for. Chemotherapy has better results and it's literally just filling you with poison. No one cares about mental health, and it's wrong how many people make money to spread this delusion that meds and therapy will fix it. I am soon to be non-living proof that it doesn't.

I moved to another continent where the pittance I receive for disability can actually provide me food, water and shelter if I'm extremely careful. I didn't have any friends there, nor do I here. Family wants nothing to do with me. This is the first time in weeks I've even had the energy to get on the internet.

1pp9gpq,how do i keep pushing without feeling miserable?,"for starters, i am 17, and female. starting from when i was born, my dad was abusive towards my mom. for years she endured it, never sheltered me from it. we moved out when i was 6, came back a year later, and the cycle continued up until i was 12. to this day, we live with him. they still fight pretty much every day. the physical abuse stopped at 12, but verbal/emotional/controlling abuse still occurs. 

this has severely impacted my life and mental health, and i don't think the damage will ever fix itself. nowadays, my mom tends to take her frustrations out on me. it is exhausting and depressing, because it is on and off and unpredictable. 

i spent a lot of my childhood online, trying to make friends. i was also homeschooled up until 8th grade, against my will. being online exposed me to a lot of depressing situations, which also impacted me mentally. 

i have had nearly constant feelings of depression since i was 8 years old, and prior to that i had an intense fear of being abandoned, and separation anxiety. i still have these fears, but now they are present in my relationships, both romantic and 

platonic. i also have major issues with my self image, i know i'm not pretty, and it's not just me that thinks so.

since i was 15, i've been working real jobs. my first job was at a restaurant, which i left because i felt under appreciated and very unmotivated by boredom. i now work at a fast food restaurant, where i am valued and needed but to a degree where i feel overworked, and like the only competent and capable person there. i work 5 days a week and am in public high school full time. it is incredibly taxing physically, and i already wasn't in great shape. over my summer vacation i balanced both jobs, so i haven't had much of a break from anything. i mostly support myself, but i don't make enough to do so. wages here are incredibly low. i am underpaid and overworked, mistreated at home, and stressed and exhausted at school. 

my past relationship lasted a year and a half, he mistreated me and pressured me into things, as well as distanced me from my friends and gave me a bad reputation. he still spreads rumors and things about me and tries to take my friends away. i have currently been in another relationship for over a year, but we constantly disagree on things and have a hard time managing our emotions. i love him, things just get really hard for me sometimes. i don't want to break up.

i just don't know how to cope anymore. i feel so tired and stressed out all of the time. i am severely depressed and it interferes with every aspect of my life. how do i keep going like this? i keep struggling with thoughts of giving up. i don't know where to go from here.

1ppjnca,I think some people are born to die just like some are born bad eggs,"I think about this fairly often because I feel like I am one of those people. I have made mistakes in life that I cannot take back. I have both been wronged and have wronged others and I have both been bullied and the bully. I often wonder if I was born to die and born a bad egg. This may sound like I’m pitying myself but I’ve already grieved the life I won’t be able to have, and this has pretty much the outlook I have on life now. Obviously I am not content, but I feel like there is not much I can do. I have tried to change myself and become a better person but I am either walked on or overcompensating. I’d also like to add that living and growing up in abusive households can add to the reasons as to why I turned out the way I am, but I won’t use that entirely as an excuse. People say you can change who you are but what if I can’t? Right now I am living in that same abusive household where my integrity and morals are tested and it honestly has me questioning if it is worth even considering the possibility that I’ll have a normal life, and if its worth caring about the outcome of any decision I make wether it is towards people or my own. I have grown to have so much hatred inside of my heart that I’ve considered praying to the devil. I have no idea who I am outside of my name. I’ve never had a sense of self because all my personalities were curated to be liked and fit in for the better and worse.

1ppfbbn,Hear me out,"Hello everyone, this is a ""burner account"" even though my actual account doesn't necessarily have anything memorable or identifiable. I do sincerely apologize for how long this turned out to be, if you do read this. I appreciate you, and if you didn't read this, I still appreciate you for even taking a gander. 

I am 31 years old, not that age matters but it plays a role in my world. I have been depressed for years, majority of my life I would say. I was abused physically as a child from my dad and sexually from my babysitters son. I never told anyone the latter, in a weird sick twisted way I liked it but I didn't at the same time. Such a weird concoction. Never really had friends growing up and had a stomach problem back then when IBS wasn't treatable that it ruin my social life as well. I wasn't mad about not having friends I mostly played games, watched anime and just geek out and to me that was fun.   
2008 was somewhat of a turning point as we hit a recession and my mother unfortunately was one of the victims and we got evicted from our apartment. I remember one day so vividly I called my father for help at his gym that he owned at the time, I'll never forget the venom that dripped from his voice and how cold my blood ran when he said ""don't you dare call this number again ever, you hear me?"" I was like 11 or 12 at the time, his girlfriend worked with him who at the time knew what she was doing and plotted her way into the family and ruined it. He had a daughter with her.. I have a 15 year old half sister. Can you guys believe that?  I mean I sure as shit can, he left that family as well unsurprisingly BUT he made sure he left her a job that makes 6 figures. We didn't get that, Im happy for them I guess or something along that line that everyone says. Anyways back to my sob story, had two serious boyfriends in my life, the first was my everything but hated towards the end because he cheated on me but great lesson and Im actually happy for him! He has two kids and everything he wanted. Then my second heart break or maybe my final not sure, he came around but holy crap did I not listen to my gut- she was screaming in the back of my mind saying "" He is not over his ex (fiancé I might add) and he is showing you everything and you feel it he's not right for you, why aren't you listening ?!?"" But for some reason, I needed him, I loved him and he was good for me but not really. Anyways, two years down the drain and I just knew something was wrong one day, he picked up his phone and said he is playing scrabble with the boys.. which made no sense cause he complained about that game and has dyslexia- or at least thats what he always said in the past when we did anything with spelling or whatever. So my brain said ""check her instagram"" low and behold they're following each other and got married a couple months later, Its funny... his mom his own damn mother started apologizing to me, not him but her. From what the family told me and what he told me in the start about her is that she cheated on him (funnily enough before we fell into a relationship I blurted out, somewhere down the line you're going to go back to her and its gonna hurt me.. but please stop talking bad about her, of course he said no he would never.. oh how the turn tables). I had to tell his mother  to stop talking bad about her and her son is happy so just be patient and everything will be okay. Oddly enough on my birthday this past September his aunt messaged me (which is weird because why?) telling me she didn't get invited to the gender reveal and their excuse was they wanted something intimate but her whole side of the family is invited. I don't think I needed to know that, I didn't know how to respond to the message as she said she thinks it had something to do with me, I said it had nothing to do with me but you can unfollow me and maybe that will help? She said hell no lol. Before anyone says something like you should've unfollowed them from the start... you're right I should've but a part of me wanted to be in a family, a big beautiful family, thats loving and warm. See I didn't have that growing up, I yearn for it. Holidays get really depressing for me, the older I get the more I just sit with my sadness, I don't even think it's a diagnosis of chronically depressed... at this point, it's me- my soul. I like to explain it like Im naturally depressed, I get seasonally happy but for such a short period of time. 

I just quit my job, wasn't good for me, the medical field drained me. I think during Covid is just showed me how nasty the world can be, not just in the ""ew they're coughing on everything"" but the nasty that is so dark, the greed, the hate. I dont think people actually love people anymore. I stopped believing in God, or at least im trying to. How can someone so holy create so much pain. I will not get further into this as I know everyone has thoughts and feelings about it and they're heavy, but all those kids who died in Gaza.... they're kids, babies even, all those innocent lives. They love God but where was the protection? I didn't grow up being in a partial religion I should add.. I grew up Muslim but not really, then when my father left I didn't know what to follow, my mom is Christian so I just threw the towel and just believed in a or the God. Then  I get into thoughts of where was God when I was getting hurt from the person thats supposed to protect me. Where was God when my Father was also beating up my mom? Where?

I went off in a tangent there.. anyways I've been meaning to rid myself for a while. My body says otherwise, my mind is weak, I want to go. I want to end this. There are no happy thoughts. Life has not been good. Im not adding the whole story of course.. this post is longer than anticipated... I have no one, I dont have proper income even though I still have a part time job in retail, it's not much. Im in debt. I have no friends, I try to make them.. but it's hard. My thoughts win all the time, I want to go.. disappear.. There is a pit in my chest it's empty and I have turned meaner not just to me but to everyone. When I say meaner, I  think people do not deserve the basic curtesy of human kindness anymore. No one says thank you or please anymore. People are rude, Im just one person but has anyone seen how bad humans affected animals? they're getting beaten, berated, killed for enjoyment. I wish I could help animals but im just one person who has nothing to her name. I do have pets.. I love them so much but I have failed my dog as he always ends up in the ER cause he gets into everything and anything lol.. I didn't train him right too.. he's very overreactive but he is still a puppy, I try training him and it is working sometimes but again- he is a puppy and he is trying to show dominance. I had three cats... I had to put one of  babies down in August.. I still cry about him every night. I cant do it three more times.. ya know? There are no words to explain that, no amount of tears, no amount of hugs- nothing. I had my mom there with me. I love her to death too I must mention. I always vowed to rid myself if she leaves too... The thing is my father is back in the picture and she still goes back to him... I dont get it. I try to be respectful.. I do.. it's so hard. 

I did try therapy, psychiatrist.. the psych ward... got held in one for 3 days when I was in high school. Im just tired. Mentally tired. I do not want to live anymore- I dont want my life. I want to give my life to someone who DOES want to live, who HAS a purpose, who has people who love them. Kids who are legit.. kids.... I would give my life for theirs. I dont want to live at all.. They can have my time if that makes sense. 

  
Im there for people and people aren't there for me.. Im the issue I guess. Im not sure. But im tired of being lonely, I haven't really done anything bad but I do see bad people living  great life and then innocent people dying young or barely surviving. I will find the means to kill myself, I'll sort out my babies first so they will be okay, they shouldn't suffer. My mom will suffer unfortunately but.. she shouldn't. If there is a God I hope he sheds some light and frees the weight if her heart as she deserves the world, not me. I the fucked up daughter who's 31 and didn't have a great life, didn't dabble in drugs, didn't do stupid stuff. Finished college, never found a footing or her path. I have nothing to show for myself. I am useless and a waste of space. 

I cant live like this. this sad, this loneliness, this painful yearning to be loved, to be wanted, to be seen. It's worse than hunger. Im sorry if this violates any rules.. It doesn't get better, it hasn't gotten better. I know I'm only 31 but I have been alive for a while already and all I've seen and felt is pain, sadness, lost, empty and everything not so fun. 

Im sorry if this triggers anyone, I do not want pity.. I just want ears or eyes to read it... I don't know what I'm asking for.. but  apologize for the length. I hope everyone has a wonderful evening or day and please take care of yourself.

1ppfb2c,Im alive,"I was going to take my life last week. 

 However before i was going to I was going to give money to my friend ti help him out. Turns out my paycheck was a quarter of what it was supposed to be and i couldn't help him pay his bills.
      
So Im waiting till i get more money. I cant be a dick and leave him without covering rent since he relies on that for the morgage on the house. I need to at least make myself useful. I refuse to be a dead burden. I need to at least do something useful with my existence for now.

 I have to take care of things, I have no worth outside of things done for others.

Im slowly killing myself with drinking instead but for the time being im alive. I feel sick. Im bearly able to work without throwing up and i shake really badly now. 
Nothing feels real anymore and I keep zoning out while doing things for days on end.
But im alive.
For now at least.

1pqd3n8,Does this sound like anxiety?,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder for majority of my life, so you’d think I’d be able to tell when what i’m feeling is anxiety or real. However, my symptoms are always changing.

I’ve had severe cardiophobia for as long as I can remember. I constantly have feelings of shortness of breath, racing heart, palpitations and PVCs. I’ve had a million heart tests done in my lifetime and they’ve never found anything wrong, except the heart condition I was born with but they’ve told me it’s under control and I shouldn’t have issues until my later years.

These symptoms will hit out of nowhere, as panic attacks do. I’ll randomly get SOB, my heart will be palpitating and skipping beats, and my HR will raise to about 110-120 for no seemingly reason. I just can’t believe there’s not a legit issue with me and that this is just anxiety.

I’m 22, healthy for the most part but very out of shape. I desperately want to get in the gym and get myself in better shape physically but I am terrified i’m going to fall over and die in the gym or once my heart starts racing I start panicking.

My doctors have told me I’m fine to exercise, but i’ve heard so many stories of people being misdiagnosed or completely overseen and I am terrified of being one of those people.

Then I went to a potluck they were hosting and impulsively signed up to speak on their podcast and now I’m losing it because I just anxiously blabbed without thinking and theyre going to use it and I cant stop replaying it in my head.

I did however have some good interactions though and focusing on that helps a little bit, that and being proud I got out of the house and didnt let the previous rumination stop me from going out again. I also made a cake and people really liked it.

I knew I wouldn't be able to grow (and would probably get worse) so I put together a short practice combining tools that have actually helped me: breathwork, attention redirection, and emotional labeling. It's about 3 minutes.

1pq6c86,Weed causes anxiety but used to help it ?,"So I started smoking (THC) around 2 years ago, mentally I was in a fine spot and didn’t really have anything going on but a little anxiety that didn’t really bother me outside of a few things like speaking in-front of groups etc. , and so when I started smoking i loved it i was euphoric everything was funny food was amazing but it always made me a little paranoid and really awkward (I’d have to psych myself up to leave my room and go eat in-front of my parents because it felt extremely awkward to be infront of anyone. Despite this, I kept smoking pretty heavily for 2 ish years. Eventually, I had some traumatic events and just life changing stuff happen (moved, robbed at gunpoint, gf cheated, lost all my friends etc) but I kept smoking to cope with this and it worked good and I felt fine even with everything going on, eventually I wanted to stop covering my mental health up with weed so I took a t break for 3 weeks. The t break was manageable but it definitely exacerbated my anxiety, insomnia, tension, overthinking, anhedonia. Eventually I get to the point of dealing with this I’m just banking on when I can smoke again things will feel better and back to before. On the day I take the t break I take admittedly probably too much and started freaking out over how I felt like everything was fake, I was focusing on my post nasal drip and acid reflux and getting uncomfortable in my body and my mind and basically just freaked out. The next day I smoked a again but less thinking I just smoked too much, but even at a smaller dose It just made me more anxious, paranoid and aware of what’s going on with my body.

1pqk07p,looking for advice,"i’m basically just going to copy and paste this bullet list i wrote of my biggest problems, im really interested in anyone else’s experiences especially if they are similar, and how they dealt with it.

medication wise, i have tried many different approaches and right now i am on 375mg venlafaxine and 175mg pregabalin and 2mg clonazepam to take when needed. i have severe emetophobia and my biggest anxiety symptoms are nausea and like the before vomiting symptoms

1- ANXIETY IN PUBLIC PLACES

Most of my anxiety happens in public settings and is part of the fear of vomiting or getting nauseous or anxious 

\-When my anxiety is mild, sometimes I can calm it temporarily by focusing on coping methods.

\-But as soon as I stop focusing on calming myself, the anxiety immediately comes back.

\-It feels like my brain thinks:

“Since I was anxious recently and I’m still in the same place,there’s still a reason to be anxious

This creates a loop where anxiety feels stuck and keeps returning, making it really hard to feel safe or calm while I’m in public.

2- UNPREDICTABLE ANXIETY

\-Sometimes, I can get distracted enough that I don’t feel anxious for a while (like an hour or two)

\-But then, when my brain isn’t occupied or when I’m in a quiet moment, anxiety sneaks back in.

\-I might go to a place several times — sometimes I feel okay, sometimes I feel super anxious.

\-This inconsistency makes me feel like exposure therapy is a gamble. I don’t know if I’ll be anxious or not on any given visit.

\-Because of this, I feel like exposure therapy doesn’t work for me, no matter how much I do it.

3- feeling hopeless

\-I know recovery isn’t linear, but it’s been like this for two years with no sign of lasting change.

\-This long period without improvement makes me feel very hopeless and exhausted.

\-I’m frustrated because I keep trying exposure therapy and staying in situations even when I’m really anxious and want to leave, but the fear stays just as strong.

\-Now i feel like i’m on a time limit, as i have to go to school in june and i NEED to be better

\-I feel like I can’t do exposure therapy properly because my anxiety keeps coming back repeatedly until I go home.

\-I’ve done exposure therapy many times, but it hasn’t reduced my anxiety.

\-Sometimes exposure feels like white-knuckling through terror rather than retraining my brain.

\-I’m scared that I’m stuck in this cycle, and I don’t know how to break it.

\-I don’t know what to do once I get anxious, and I feel overwhelmed by the constant fear and nausea.

\-the physical symptoms are too much for me physically, and i can’t calm my mind enough to ease them

\-stuck on past experiences 

\-Before I started medication, I used to vomit every day from anxiety.

\-This history makes my anxiety about nausea and vomiting even more intense.

\-Even if I know logically I probably won’t vomit, feeling nauseous in public is terrifying, and I just want to go home.

\-When I get anxious and nauseous in public, it feels overwhelming, and I often feel like I need to leave immediately to feel safe.

5- difficultly challenging thoughts

1I have intrusive “what if” thoughts, especially around anxiety itself (like “What if I get anxious?”).

\-I know I’m supposed to challenge these thoughts with something like “What if I don’t?” but my brain feels so much stronger on the side of “Yeah, but WHAT IF I DO?”

\-This makes it really hard to use cognitive strategies to calm myself because the fearful side of my mind always wins.

\-It feels like my brain is stuck in a loop of worst-case scenarios, which keeps my anxiety high and prevents progress.

\-One of the biggest challenges for me is that my mind feels like my biggest blocker. I can’t control the anxious thoughts no matter how hard I try. It’s like my brain runs on its own, especially the ‘what if’ thoughts—they’re so loud and persistent that I can’t argue them away. Even when I want to calm down or think differently, the anxious thoughts keep taking over and make everything feel overwhelming.",1,0,2025-12-19 18:05:06,Intelligent-Ease158,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pqk07p/looking_for_advice/,anxiety,1.0,Advice Needed,-0.7743,0.053106150793650816,0.0,-1,-0.22166876984126982,-1
1pqjwnd,Restarting Lexapro.. please share your success stories 😞,"Hi everyone. I could really use some encouragement right now.

I’m restarting Lexapro, and the nausea has been rough. The last time I tried it, I only made it about 5 days before I had a really bad panic attack and stopped taking it. I’ve been scared ever since, but my anxiety has been getting worse, and I truly feel like Lexapro could benefit me if I can just get through this beginning phase.

Right now, the nausea and anxiety spikes are making me second guess everything. I keep wondering if I should push through or if this means it’s not for me. This initial period really sucks, and my health anxiety isn’t helping at all.

If Lexapro worked for you, especially if the first couple of weeks were hard, please tell me your success story. How long did the side effects last? When did you start feeling relief? Was it worth pushing through?

1pqjlaz,Question about the antidepressant Seroplex,"Hi !

It's been almost three months since I started suffering from health-related anxiety. I saw my doctor again yesterday, and I told her about the improvements I've made since the beginning (that I no longer have panic attacks), but I also talked about the stress I feel every day, the constant worries, and the pain I've been experiencing. She said it might be a good idea to start taking an antidepressant (Seroplex 5mg).

But when I see all the side effects during the first few months, well, I'm simply scared. I already have a lot of worries about the ""symptoms"" of anxiety (muscle pain, stomach pain, nausea, fatigue, general malaise... the list goes on), so if it's just going to make me even more anxious, I wonder if it's really a good idea.

1pq8c6x,Can’t sleep because of health anxiety,"It’s been a rough week. Went to the ER twice. It started with pain on my right calf that radiated to my thigh. I went to the ER because I was scared of a DVT because I take the pill and I occasionally smoke.

I waited 10 hours there, it was horrible. They took a first blood test where they told me that my d-dimer was positive and I needed to take a second blood test to confirm. This blood test is there to indicate if you have a blood clot or not. I was so scared. They took a second blood test, and it was negative.

Apparently, if it’s negative, then it’s negative. The negative test takes over the positive test.

2 days after, I did an echo of my leg, but when I did, the pain already left, so I told myself, of course they won’t find anything, the blood clot is already traveling to my lungs.

Now, it’s been 3 days since I have this weird sensation in my chest, with a slight pain when I breathe, and I’ve been convinced I have pulmonary embolism.

The only thing that would rule out PE, would be a CT scan of my lungs, but I feel like it’s hard to get. I took an appointment to the doctor for tomorrow to BEG for one, but now it’s 2:30am and I can’t sleep because I’m too scared of dying in my sleep.

My throat feels like it’s closing, and I’m trying as hard as I can to tell myself that you have a hard time breathing not because of the potential PE, but because of your anxiety.

1pqfgjg,Weird heart sensation,"About two weeks ago I think I had a panic attack outside of the grocery store, which is unusual for me. Usually my anxiety is more of a lingering feeling that keeps me bedridden for a while. Leading up to the attack, I was feeling a bit shaky and jittery until it all just came to a head and my whole body felt like it was on fire. What concerned me though was my heart. I had the expected tachycardia but then my heart did this weird double beat or skipped beat? It’s hard to describe because in the moment it’s so scary and hard to keep track of. It literally took my breath away. It felt like my heart hiccuped or as if it got stuck for a second which only made me panic even more, causing it to happen maybe 3-4 times over. Eventually I calmed down and they stopped but I was so anxious for the rest of the day and even the following day.

Yesterday, it happened again, though I handled it a lot better than I did before. It still scared the crap out of me and I worry that this is damaging my heart. I’ve gotten my heart checked before but that time I was not experiencing this. I also can’t see a doctor until January and the suspense is eating away at me.

I get normal PVCs but these feel so different and only happen when I panic. They don’t tend to occur whenever my heart normally accelerates from exertion either.

I can describe it is it like it feels like there is still pee that needs to get soon after I pee. However, whenever I try to go only a small amount comes out. It is not painful to pee, but gets annoying when I wake up several times a night and feel the urge to pee. Especially during the day too when I feel the need to pee soon after just going to the bathroom.

I went to urgent care, saw a PA, and they did a dipstick test today which is negative so they don't think I have a UTI. They are wondering if it could be prostatitis, but I'm not sure if that's a thing with negative dipstick. I didn't accept the prostate exam.

1pqimhi,anxiety or something more,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to hear from people who might relate, because my diagnosis has been unclear for many years, and my psychiatrist isn’t fully sure. I am not looking for diagnosis, just for people who might feel similar.

Everything started at 19 when I went on the pill – I became extremely emotional, cried a lot, and felt very unstable. After stopping it, things improved, but since my 20s and 30s I’ve continued to struggle on and off.

My symptoms over the years:

Frequent nervousness and anxiety (mostly worry, often about relationships, but also various other things) (no physical symptoms)

Periods of low mood (never suicidal, but times where I felt really bad for 1,2 weeks)

Episodes of very strong inner tension, very often starting or getting worse in the afternoon

occasional irritability

A lot of overthinking and catastrophising

At times my emotional “skin” feels very thin and I can’t regulate my emotions

Some days I feel emotionally flat or blank

Relationship conflict is a big trigger (but my partner and I are arguably very different, which often makes things quite hard). Sometimes symptoms seem to come out of nowhere,at least I think so. Often the “trigger” seems to be worried thoughts, and I don’t always consciously feel an external trigger.

I’ve also had months where I felt pretty symptom-free (often when I was single, less rumination and relationship worry), but also apart from that. (a couple of days mostly, sometimes weels)

A former psychologist thinks this is “just anxiety”, mostly triggered by events or thoughts. They also suggested I might have health anxiety, possibly related to my dad’s serious diagnosis (Bipolar 1), which made me very aware of this illness. That explanation partly makes sense to me — but it also feels incomplete given the intensity of my emotional reactions at times/ like I have no control over them. But maybe anxiety can come in waves/ with symptom-free days/ weeks?

As my dad has Bipolar 1, bipolar spectrum is also on the table. But I don’t experience clear hypomania that others would notice. I do have days where I feel genuinely happy, calm, and worry-free, but nothing extreme or risky

Also, Antidepressants have only helped slightly, never fully or consistently

I am currently on vortioxetine and feel somewhat more stable, but still have periods of low mood, anxiety, and emotional vulnerability. Also I almost always start getting very tense in the late afternoon (this happens to me very often).

Overall, I am functional, have a lot of friends (who help me distract myself, which often works and results in a better mood at least for some hours) But my moods also often get me to withdraw socially because it would be too exhausting to mingle; and very often I have to pretend in order not to show my emotions/how I really feel.

My psychiatrist is unsure whether this could be:

anxiety + sometimes very low depression (possibly health anxiety)

bipolar spectrum / cyclothymia

something psychodynamic (which leads to anxiety)

Thanks so much for reading. Any shared experiences/ feedback on medication are highly appreciated.

Whenever I try to form my own opinions, beliefs, worldview, etc. (so pretty much anything that's related to forming myself as a person; the specific thing being thought about does not matter at all), I feel like there is an invisible critic inside my head that constantly berates my attempts to do so.

I didn’t analyze Myself  until I got older and realized even tho I struggle with diff things and overthinking them what persists the worry is essentially the same every time so different situations but same triggers that end up making me spiral . For a long time now I’ve been having scary dreams in either being chased in them , someone is trying to hurt me or just something bad is happening. 

When I was younger I would have these reoccurring dreams where there were a set of two stairs one the was dark and had creeepy eerie feel to it and the other that had a shining bright light I never dared to go down the creepy ones but everytime I went up the light path I got chased and when I would try to get help no one would help me and I had to hide and stuff. I didn’t know why those happened cause I didn’t feel any worries in the surface of my mind but those happened for a long time. I did try and talk to my family member about my worries and stuff but like the same things are still bothering me and I feel like it’s all I think about and I wanna be a normal person who just thinks about what to have for lunch come home and relax and watch tv and not be worried about anything

 but it feels so heavy on me I have a tendency to be extremely catastrophic in my thinking Ik that my brain is just playing with me but at the same time the lines get blurry and idk what part of my brain is working correctly I just don’t know if to talk to someone I trust again I don’t wanna bug them or make them feel

Annoyed since we have discussed my issues before and technically if I brought it up again it would serve no purpose because we have already talked about it and there nothing we can rlly do so I shouldn’t even have any worries.

1pqfwof,Am I being anxious or should I be concerned?,"Trigger warning: Sickness

A few weeks ago, my dog was having issues. It isn't clear exactly what it was. But when I was trying to bring her with me someplace, she relived herself on the curb beside my car. It was a disgusting puddle which I felt a bit too scared to clean, and I wasn't sure how to. So I went back inside to take care of the dog. 

Hours later, I leave and return home, having forgotten about the puddle. Thereby scraping it over my tires and the tiny portion of curb where I park. Disgusting and now impossible to clean. 

Today, I'm getting out of my car, parked on the side of the curb; and I drop my phone into the muddy grass besie the curb. Seems meaningless. Except it's dark and I can't tell how much of the phone landed on grass or curb. If it's even a concern after all these weeks since it happened. So I pick my phone up by its back, which shouldn't have been touched by any of it, bring it in, and don't touch it. 

Then I eat dinner. 

Now, I can't stop worrying about it. I, stupidly (as can be surmised based on the actions so far. Good decisions illude me), can't recall wether I fully washed my hands before eating. To avoid being worried, I tried marking my food where ever I was worried I'd touched it. But I fear I may have hit marked areas while eating. I pulled the food out the garbage to check, but can't tell. I think it'd be fairly obvious if I got anything on my own food. But then again, sickness wouldn't happen so often if it were.

1ppve0y,"why your brain won't shut up (and why ""calming down"" isn't the answer)","I was sitting at my desk today, just staring at my biochemistry notes and that familiar, sharp static started in my chest. You know the one... it’s like a humming wire that won’t go quiet. For years i thought i was failing at being ""calm."" I¿d try to meditate or think positive but it felt like trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol. It’s just... it’s exhausting to feel like you’re constantly at war with your own head. I’ve been digging into the science of this to try and find some air, and I realized something that actually brought me a lot of relief. Our brains have this thing called a salience network. Basically, it’s a filter that decides what is ""important"" enough to notice. When you’re anxious, that filter gets stuck. It starts flagging everything, the way your heart is beating, a weird look from a coworker, a thought about next year, as a life-or-death threat. 

It’s just your biology getting the signals wrong. It’s actually trying to be helpful, in a really annoying way. It feels that spike of cortisol and it thinks: 'There must be a bear somewhere. If I can't find a bear, I'll find a problem in my life to obsess over until it matches how I feel. 

This is why ""motivation"" or ""staying positive"" usually fails us. Our brains doesn’t want motivation when it’s in survival mode it wants direction, it needs to know where to put all that ""fight or flight"" energy so it doesn't just eat you alive from the inside. 

When my chest starts that buzzing now i’ve stopped trying to talk myself out of it. I don’t think the amygdala the part of the brain that’s panicking, even understands English, honestly. It doesn't care about my ""affirmations."" It only understands action.

So I give it a very small, very dumb job. I’ll go to the sink and put my hands under the coldest water possible. Or I’ll sit on the floor and try to find five different ""brown"" things in the room. It’s not about ""distraction"" it’s about giving the brain a new, concrete direction to focus its salience on. It tells the nervous system: ""The threat isn't that thought about the future, the reality is this cold water on my skin."" 

I’m not saying this is a cure. I still have bad days where the static is too loud to hear anything else. But knowing it’s just my biology trying (and failing) to protect me makes it a little less scary. You aren't weak because you can't ""think"" your way out of a panic attack. You’re just a person with a very sensitive alarm system. 

Sometimes, the best thing you can do is just give that alarm a different job to do for five minutes. i don't know if that makes sense to anyone else, but it's the only thing that's helped me breathe lately.",16,4,2025-12-18 22:08:51,BioChem_Writer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ppve0y/why_your_brain_wont_shut_up_and_why_calming_down/,anxiety,0.91,Helpful Tips!,-0.9882,-0.023277338603425558,-0.7379652857780457,-1,-0.6700981106097079,-1

1pqeijw,Been struggling with dizziness disassociation and headaches,"About two months ago I had a big night out where I got high and drunk and had fun. I woke up feeling fine when three hours later a sudden, extreme fatigue onset. The fatigue was literally pulling my eyes and arms down as I tried to stay awake driving home. It created huge anxiety in me because I was scared I messed something with my brain up considering all the substances. Went to sleep and woke feeling so so horrendous and dizzy out of my mind. This continued for a week which was also accompanied by extreme anxiety, and constant panic attacks, to the point where I felt like I couldn’t  feel my legs(still wondering wether this was completely mental). Saw my mom collapse screaming my name saying she couldn’t feel her arm and conveniently a couple days later my symptoms flared up again along with a new fear that I couldn’t feel or move body parts. It’s been two month, and the dizziness is mostly completely gone, but I have lingering ice pick stabbing headaches. I also have lots of disassociation. Looking in the mirror makes me feel like seeing a person I’ve never seen in my life before. Walking through hallways of school feels like a videgame. Everything is flat. It should be 3d but it’s 2d. It gives me extreme anxiety which makes me feel like body parts are tingling, numb, vision getting worse or hearing, etc. Don’t know if everything at this point is now mental, but the biggest thing that bothers me is what caused it. Especially considering it’s been two months now and my anxiety is horrible. Done countless tests, and I honestly feel stupid I blew so much money on testing for mri, blood, eyes, ears etc to all be normal all because I wanted a good time.

1ppzj7b,Buspirone?,"Hello! I was in Lexapro for 3 years and it helped with my anxiety but caused a lot of weight gain. So I slowly tapered off if it. But after stopping, I developed severe chronic insomnia (it can take 2 to 6 hours to fall asleep most nights, and I have frequent hypnic jerks that happen every time I am just about to fall asleep- way more than the normal amount). I've seen many doctors about this but I have not tried going back on anti-anxiety meds, so I have reached the point of trying that again.

Psychiatrist today recommended Effexor OR Buspirone as something different to try. As an anxious person who also has phobias (specifically emetophobia), I am of course nervous about side effects as well as effectiveness. I know that everyone is different, but I am curious to hear about people's experiences with Buspirone (and maybe Effexor too, but the psychiatrist and I decided on trying Buspirone first).  
\*Typical short term side effects? (mostly worried about nausea and vomiting)  
\*Typical long term side effects? (High BP or weight gain?)  
\*Those who also suffer from insomnia: did it help? Or no effect? Or did it make it worse?  
\*Did you generally feel better on Buspirone?  
\*Is long term use typically safe?  
\*Anything else I should know?

I did speak with the doctor about my concerns, but I like to hear from people who have taken it, too.

1ppofx1,Terrifying physical symptoms despite normal heart tests. Has anyone else been through this and how did you cope?,"Hi everyone, I’m a 21‑year‑old male. I’ve always had some health anxiety since around 2022, but it never produced physical symptoms until recently.

On 26th March 2025, my life changed. I left home feeling fine, went to town for a haircut, and after buying a vape and sitting in the barber’s chair, I suddenly felt like I was going to collapse. My heart was pounding 150+ bpm, I was dizzy, sweaty, nauseous, and terrified. I told the barber to stop, rushed out, and phoned my girlfriend saying “I think I’m dying.” I tried water and chocolate in case it was blood sugar, but nothing helped. I went to a GP surgery, they did a 6‑lead ECG which showed sinus tachycardia, but otherwise normal. Paramedics arrived, but the GPs said I didn’t need hospital. I went home still feeling awful.

Since then, episodes kept happening. In April, while queuing for coffee with my girlfriend, the same thing hit me again — pounding heart, dizziness, feeling seconds from collapse. I didn’t seek medical help that time but felt unwell for hours. At home, similar episodes happened repeatedly.

In May, I woke with a mild fever, stayed home to avoid passing it to my family, and later that day spat up blood with sharp right‑sided chest pain. My heart raced, I felt faint, dry‑mouthed, and terrified. I phoned an ambulance, but they were delayed, so I went to my neighbour who thought it was a heart attack. At A&E, ECG, troponin, and bloods were normal except raised inflammatory markers. They diagnosed pericarditis and gave me ibuprofen. Symptoms didn’t improve. A few days later, another ambulance was called — again, fast heart rate and high blood pressure, but no dangerous findings.

Soon after, while walking with my girlfriend and son, I had another severe dizzy spell with HR 145 and cotton‑dry mouth. The ANP sent me to hospital, even debating resus. At CAU, I felt nauseous, faint, chest/upper stomach pain. ECG showed a “change” but they later said inflammation was gone and I didn’t have pericarditis after all. I was sent home again, no answers.

Episodes kept happening — even when I was happy collecting my college exam results, I had severe chest pain and racing heart for hours, called another ambulance, but again nothing dangerous was found. My GP finally referred me urgently to cardiology.

Cardiology tests:

• 24‑hour Holter monitor (though it stopped recording during one episode)
• Echocardiogram
• ECG in clinic


All normal. Cardiologist told me it wasn’t a heart issue, but couldn’t give a 100% guarantee. That left me anxious and frustrated.

Since then, symptoms have been constant: fluttering palpitations in chest/neck, sometimes even with low heart rate, blurry vision, dizziness, exhaustion, feeling seconds from collapse. GP said no more cardiac tests would be done, gave me more bloods (normal) and prescribed fluoxetine for anxiety. I’ve been on 20mg for 26 days, but it hasn’t helped. I feel like every minute of every day I’m lightheaded, exhausted, and not right at all.


My struggle now:
I can’t shake the fear that I have an undiagnosed condition that could cause sudden death. Even though the tests are normal, I keep thinking “what if they missed something.” I feel like I can’t live my life because I’m waiting for collapse.

Has anyone else gone through something like this — terrifying physical symptoms, normal tests, and being told it’s anxiety? Did your symptoms ever fade? How did you cope with the constant fear?

1pqe35t,Debilitating anxiety,"I just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone had any advice or had a similar experience. So in January of 2025 I got sick some kind of infection, urgent care said it was a throat infection but I think it was a form of mono. (The doctor didn’t test me for it so still unsure) After that I had developed debilitating anxiety to where I had a panic attack just thinking about leaving the house. But before that I did have a slight panic attack while I was at a broadway show I didn’t really think anything of it at the time because I was a anxious person before this but I learned how to live with it. So it’s almost a year that I’ve developed this intense anxiety and still no change I can leave the house without having a panic attack now but I will have one if I’m out too long. I also get anxiety even if a friend or family comes over. And honestly I haven’t pushed myself. I’m in therapy and I tried lexapro it did nothing for me. I also quit smoking weed around 2019 2020 because I passed out from it three times I picked it up again in 2024 I don’t remember the month and I still use it at night. It doesn’t help with my anxiety so I don’t know why I still do it. But I’m just wondering maybe it’s the weed that caused this? Or my hormones could be all wacky? I went to the doctor in March of 2025 and everything came back fine so it’s not my thyroid or vitamin levels. I’m just curious if anyone has a same experience and what they did to get out of it.

I don’t have vision loss, double vision, headaches, weakness, or confusion. it’s more like my brain is over-processing motion. I’m fully aware, oriented, and functioning, but the perception itself is unsettling.

This symptom has become constant, and it’s really affecting my day-to-day life. I’ve started avoiding leaving the house because the stress of noticing it everywhere is overwhelming. And I don’t feel safe driving. 

Some context:
- I have an anxiety disorder and just got off of Lexapro 3 months ago. 
- This has happened before I was on Lexapro and once I started and these symptoms went away
- I currently have a lot of stress in my life 

The more I focus on the visual symptom, the worse it feels, which makes me think it’s anxiety-related, but it’s hard not to spiral when it’s happening all the time.

I guess I’m looking to see if anyone else has  experienced this and if it was anxiety related. ",2,1,2025-12-19 08:09:11,jjaaddeenn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pq9qlm/is_this_anxiety/,anxiety,1.0,Advice Needed,-0.9528,0.08966666666666667,-0.4705435335636139,-1,-0.5031784334484736,-1
1pq9jgj,Sudden change in the behaviour of my anxiety,"Hi everyone,

28yo male from Canada.

I wanted to share an experience and see if others have had something similar.

A few weeks ago in Mexico, my partner and I were likely dehydrated after several very active days in hot weather. One night she became extremely weak and nauseous and collapsed in the bathroom. Seeing her on the floor triggered a very unusual reaction in me.

Normally my anxiety shows up as high heart rate, adrenaline, and high BP sensations. But this time, I had the opposite: intense weakness, nausea, cold sweats, dark spots in my vision, and a strong feeling I might faint. I’ve never felt that before. What helped was a cold shower and drinking sugar + water. We both recovered after that and felt fine the following days.

Since that event, my anxiety/panic attacks feel different. I’ll feel an initial stress/adrenaline surge, but then it quickly shifts into weakness, nausea, and a faint-like feeling (but I’ve never actually passed out). It feels very different from my old panic symptoms.

I’m wondering if anyone has experienced a change in how anxiety presents after a real physical scare or near-fainting episode, especially with more vagal-type symptoms.

I’m functional otherwise and feel normal between episodes. I’m not sure if this is something that typically settles on its own or if it’s worth pushing for further testing, or if this is more of a nervous-system conditioning thing.

Would appreciate hearing similar experiences",2,2,2025-12-19 07:59:51,Objective_Gas_8247,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pq9jgj/sudden_change_in_the_behaviour_of_my_anxiety/,anxiety,1.0,Advice Needed,-0.7425,0.05893162393162393,0.0,-1,-0.2109636752136752,-1
1ppuwjv,How has Medication helped your Anxiety?,"I (24M) have struggled with anxiety since I've been an adult, and it has grown quite severe in the last several years. For me, there is limited physical symptoms (typically a shakiness in the chest, and the occasional accelerated heart rate during big anxiety attacks) but significant mental turmoil. My mind races all day, almost every day. It typically finds an old guilty or shameful memory to spiral about, and wrecks my self confidence and peace constantly. Whenever I finally find a way to forgive myself or otherwise get over the particular memory, a new one rises to take its place - usually within 24 hours.

I've never tried any form of medication. I use marijuana, but that can often feel like I'm just numbing the pain instead of trying to find a way to move past it, if that makes sense. I think weed has certainly helped me cope, but don't see it as a long term solution for my anxiety. I'm also not looking for medication as a ""magical fix"" for my anxiety, I am in therapy and am actively introspecting and working to understand the roots and underlying causes of these anxious spirals. I know that it can take more than a prescription to truly heal.

I'm curious if anyone can share how starting medication has helped them through their anxiety. I've read several stories on here regarding how much it's helped people, which has me thinking of discussing it with my therapist and doctor. I think i haven't pursued medication myself for a few reasons. I'm afraid it will change my personality or make me numb, and even more I think I fear trying medication and it not helping me. Those may be irrational fears, but they are the ones I have.

If anyone has any stories or advice, I'd love to hear.

1pqcciy,Cant get over my past traumas. Am i being ridiculous?,"For starters this may not seem like a ""big"" problem for some people so i just want to say sorry to those who suffered much more than me. About 1.5 years ago I had a problem with almost all of my friends and cut contact. It was half my fault and half theirs i can say. Some hated me so much that since then I can't get over my anxiety. Everyday i wake up thinking are they going to ruin my life? do something so bad that my whole life will turn upside down again? (Not physically btw). During this time, i got married, made new friends and built my life. But now, whenever i am happy, i get the feeling that if i be too happy, something bad will happen and i fear that so much. I went to therapy, it helped reduce my anxiety and of course time did also help but I cant completely get over these fears. By fears; i mean like what if someone i don't talk to text me, or call me for whatever reason, so that would make me anxious again. Or what if someone calls my husband and talk about my past mistakes in life. (Btw, I never did and never would do something that would jeopardize my marriage, i love and respect my marriage) but you get the thing. So my question is, am I being ridiculous by thinking after 1.5 years people would still hate me and do something to ruin my life? I know that I'm not THAT important to them to think about me after all this time, but still.

1pqc3jn,Don’t be like me,"Like me, I’m sure a lot of you in this sub get into that vicious loop of forgetting to respond to a friend or loved one’s phone call or text message right away. You tell yourself you’ll respond later. Then one day, two days, maybe even three days go by and you suddenly realize you forgot to reply to them. If you’re like me, your anxiety will spike and convince you that by then it’s too late to respond. It convinces you that because you didn’t respond right away, that person probably hates you now and is angry at you, so it’s just better to stay quiet instead of facing someone you think you’ve probably now upset. If you’re like me this has most likely cost you friendships and relationships that were very important to you without even meaning to do it. 

Don’t be like me. Don’t let anxiety get the best of you because one day you’ll regret it and you’ll hurt even worse. 

I let my own insecurities and anxiety keep me from reaching out to a friend I was once very close with. We had drifted apart over the years. One year she sent me a letter in the mail, but I was too afraid to open it because I had convinced myself she was writing to tell me I had hurt her for letting our friendship drift away. I convinced myself she was probably angry with me. So I didn’t open it, out of fear. I let it sit there, unopened for two years. 

A few weeks ago, one of our mutual friends told me that my friend was in the hospital. It was bad and she wasn’t going to get better. I finally opened the letter that night while I was sitting in the parking lot of the hospital. 

She wasn’t mad at me. She had written to tell me she was thinking of me and missed me. She congratulated me on the birth of my nephew. All those years I spent, worried and convincing myself *not* to open that letter. I should have just opened it the day I got it, but I allowed myself to let my anxiety take over and steer the wheel. I couldn’t even say goodbye, because by then her condition was so bad that they were only allowing family to visit. I never got to say goodbye. I never got to tell her how sorry and how stupid I was. And the next time I see her, it will be at her funeral in a few days. 

So please, don’t be like me. Pick up the phone and call your loved ones and friends-even if you think a few days going by means it’s too late to respond. Read that text that’s still sitting untouched in your phone-even when you’re afraid it could be something bad. Open the damn letter and read it and *reach back out*. Don’t let years go by before you finally do because by then it really will be too late and you’ll be drowning in regret. And if there’s one thing this painful lesson has taught me, it’s that regret can hurt you a hell of a lot more than your anxiety.

I overcame health anxiety about 20 years ago, with only occasional, brief flare ups, and then mostly symptoms that barely faze me. Today I am totally fine. 

Ignore it. You know it’s your mind playing tricks on you. The more you struggle with it wanting to make it go away, the less it will go away. During the day when it’s not happening, the less you see it as a problem and see that it’s a product of your own concern, the less it will happen. You will learn that you do control it, it’s not something that happens for no reason, but that control comes from not thinking or worrying about it. You might anyway,  but just don’t get wrapped up in thinking about it. If you can’t stop it, so be it—what you really stop is you own reaction to it anyway—at least settle for bringing it down a couple notches and not adding to the anxiety.

1pptvnt,Unnecessarily Angry,"I suppose this is more of a question yet I do want to engage in discussion about it.

Does anyone wake up, whether in early morning or in the middle of the night, and you are just assaulted with fears and worries, or in my case, things that trigger you when before, they didn’t, but now they do?

I just think about things when I don’t want to and I feel just so pissed off I can’t get out of it. I lose all reason and while I don’t lash out, I feel violently angry and frustrated that it’s over seemingly nothing.

1pq8zkh,Drinks on Lexapro?,"Is it okay to have one drink or two on Lexapro?

I just started at 5mg and wanted to know if I can have some wine on Christmas. I did tell my psych I drink occasionally and she didn’t say anything about it when she prescribed the Lexapro but I wanted to see if anyone has any experience.

For reference, I used to be on 25 mg of Zoloft and drank pretty regularly back then and had no issues/didn’t feel more drunk or anything but idk how similar these are.

1pq3ypy,Can barely eat/swallow and it’s genuinely ruining my life,"I don’t know if this is an anxiety thing, but I’d assume it is since I’ve never had the problem before, aside from trying to swallow pills which always took me a while. This started months ago, I wanna say maybe August and it’s consuming life and I feel so helpless. I have to chew my food until it’s basically liquid and then I struggle to swallow it, almost like I am worried it will get caught in my esophagus or tonsils? But i kind of just hold it in my mouth and swallow the extremely chewed food in portions. It really sucks and it’s led to me avoiding eating a lot and my weight to fluctuate, and especially avoid eating with friends and public because it’s embarrassing. I often have to burp after swallowing near every bite and if I try to eat fast I choke.

1pq8um2,My experience with sertraline.,"Before taking it, I had a ton of anxiety pretty much constantly and some depression.  My first dosage was 50 mg which was a lot.  I took it at night before studying.  I studied for a few hours,- then went to bed.  I got no sleep.  The next day I try to  sleep the whole day.  I finally fall asleep at 1 am.  I wake up at 6:30 am and study for my final.  After my final, I sleep for a  few hours.
 After i wake up, I hang out with some people until we go to bed.  I cant sleep for some reason.  I remember the sertraline and that i should take.  Somehow I hadn't realized the sertraline was the problem.  I didn't sleep that night.  I called my mom in the morning, crying.  Shes a doctor so I thought she might help.  She recommended what you'd usually recommend for someone with normal insomnia,  

THEN I realized it was the sertraline.  Apparently you just have to wait for those things to go away.  The severe nausea appetite loss lack of thirstynese constant vomiting and white/hot flashes i just had to deal with. Not to mention the severe anxiety it gave me.

I went to the er for this for 7 hours and was never seen.  I came back to my campus and picked up a prescription for benzos. - 4  .5 mg of lorezepam.  Great.  I took a shower, took 1 mg of lorezepam and sort of feel asleep for half an hour.  I woke up panicking and shivering and so cold I didn't want to sleep again.  My mom (doctor) prescribed me anti nausea medicine. ( I was throwing up everything i ate and drink and I was really dehydrated).  My friend picked up the medicine for me since i was having cold flashes and didn't want to go outside in the freezing cold again.
.
My friend and I hung out for a bit while my dad came to pick me up from school.  My dad wouldn't have picked me up but they were concerned id have to go to the hospital.

My friend let me rest my head on his shoulder. I felt a bit better being close to someone and holding his hand grounded me but I still.felt so nauseous despite the anti nausea medicine.

On the car ride something broke.  I could sleep again?! In increments while listening to a video.  It wasn't deep sleep but I must have lost consciousness at points.  It wasn't true sleep but it was nice.  Everytime i woke uo from one of these i had a wave of severe anxiety pass through me.

I took a hot bath once we got back, and ate and drink.  I took 1 mg of lorezepam and melatonin.  I fell asleep eventually, and slept for the whole night.

1pq8eu7,Death Anxiety,"Hello. I know this might be a repetitive topic on this subreddit but the past couple of days this type of anxiety of mine has been pretty strong and scary. I just need to get it out.

I’ve read a couple posts on this trying to calm myself down but it’s like no one is capturing my exact fear of death, no one is really saying anything to help. So this is mostly for myself too.

I’m 17 and I’ve been deeply afraid of death since I was maybe 10 or 11. I’m not religious even though sometimes I really wish I was just so I could believe there is actually something after. Whenever I think about the fact that when I die, I will not be able to feel or sense anymore. I won’t be able to hear my heart beat in my chest I won’t be able to move my body. I won’t be able to do the things I want to do anymore. I know that at that point I won’t be worried of these things because well, I’m dead, but at the same time before that happens I think for a while, I’ll be very afraid. It’s human nature to have these fears, fear of the unknown just like humans are afraid of the infinity of space or for that matter, change. Just like how dying is changing from one condition to another.

I feel like I don’t have enough time, and it’s funny saying this when I haven’t even hit 20, but there’s just so much to do and see on this planet that I don’t want to leave it. I want to read every single book, I want to see every single movie. I want to be everyone in this World, I want to be African, Asian, rich, poor, sick, healthy, everything.

I want things to change, I want the world to be a better place, where humans can live equally and not destroy our planet for money and fuel. I’m sure I won’t be able to see that change and I might even die to it.

I’ve seen a bunch of people saying that you won’t feel anything after dying so why be afraid of it? I get that, I understand it kind of but I don’t want that. I don’t want to live forever either because that would become repetitive and boring but for some reason I want to hang on to the consciousness I have until I can. In my dream after we die we have an option to be conscious again. To look down on the World, on our people. We die and we come back into the World when we are deemed ready. I want it to be like a nap, a nap where after you wake up a bunch of time has passed.

The nap thing made me remember another post I read about how sleeping is kind of a “mini-death” but the thing is you wake up after sleeping, in death, you don’t dream or wake up after falling so what’s after?

Whenever I think about these things, about not existing anxiety rushes through me and I break out in a sweat, I’ve cried countless times over this but writing this post helped. Thank you for reading if you have made it this far.

1pq2949,Anxiety-Anxiety free-Theory you all can agree,"I suffer from GAD and OCD,

I mean, the anxiety was under contoll but got worse only at 23 ! untill 23 I could sleep well and breathe well!! (By sciene mental issues become severe from the 20').

But now, endless loop of meds and Psych! Cant sleep!

  
Mirtazapine is the only thing that tuned it down (The fight or flight) and helped me sleep-but that stopped wYorking..

  
It is a loop, that if you have GAD everyday and night is like russian roulte.

  
I mean, When flight or fight activated-yoy body think you are in danger so he does that:

  
ED disfcuntion(who is horny when you are under threat?), insomnia, 800 heart beats in min, SHALLOW BEATHING (the explain to that is that the VAGUS nerve is tickle,,), tight chests, etc...



I know! I know what is the be anxiety free-Your organ down there work, you eat, you sleep, you dont feel like your are going to die, you can actually breath!

  
Honestly, I just need to figure it out, how to fix this horrible CNS system,

  
How can I be stablize agian?

  
I am consodering taking SSRI but, the risk of the PSSD and sexual disfuction scare me, I mean, 1 pill that i tried of PROJACK, 1 PILL!! AND I COULD NOT GET ERRECTION OR ORGSAM!!!!

  
So, what the hell are doing from here?

  
Just to be, because of anxiety I:

  
Pay 400 dollar to Psych app', take VIAGRA, Benzo for sleep only (Mirtazapine loss effect), smoke like 800 cirrargte during attacks, anxiety suck my life out.



I mean-if you have anxiety seems like you already lost: Wheneven you want or not you have 2 main options:

  
1.treat it, by meds (cbt not for severe bioglic GAD)-and get horrible side effect, insomnia, antipsyhtoic, memory loss, sexual discuntion, and more...

  
2,Dont treat it-but you suffer daily

1pq23sx,How to get diagnosed with panic/anxiety disorder?,"Since June 2025 I’ve been having sudden episodes where I feel very weak, faint, and my heart rate spikes (110–130 bpm). Today it happened again while walking; I almost felt like passing out. It usually settles within 10–20 minutes.

I’ve seen my GP many times. Blood tests were normal. I saw a cardiologist in September (ECG + bike stress test), all normal except a persistently high heart rate, IST. Because nothing physical was found, I was referred to a mental health provider, but they couldn’t really help and didn’t find depression or another mental disorder.

I also have type 1 diabetes and was recently diagnosed with CFS, but these episodes don’t feel like either of those. It feels like something separate. At this point I feel like I’m being told “everything is fine” over and over, even when it clearly isn’t.

I almost called the GP/ER again today but didn’t, because I know they’ll say the same thing.

1pq216i,Help/Advice with catastrophic thinking,"Help/Advice with catastrophic thinking

32YO M 

Okay so I'm coming to the sub for advice about catastrophic thinking. Mainly with my son, Some brief backstory. Son is 9 Years old. Her mom and I separated when he was 3. For the first 4 years or so, his mom stayed in town, and we lived relatively close, so we did an every other day custody thing. It was amicable, but even then, I would panic whenever his mom wasn't on time, to the point where id like begin thinking something was wrong. Eventually this seemed to get better. I recognized I was overreacting to that and catastrophizing a few other things and had been for a while so I ended up getting some meds from the doctor, which again seemed to help. Got diagnosed with anxiety disorder.
Fast forward to a couple years ago and we ended up letting my son choose schools, son stayed with me while his mom moved like 30 minutes away, I ended up getting my son like 4 days a week. This year we decided to let my son pick schools and he choose her mom's. Totally fine! I didn't mind, his mom has a better school district anyway and she only lives 30 min away so I figured what the hell. Why not? Things seemed okay for awhile, I would still be going to pick him up and would wonder if things were okay, but they always had been, and always were.
So this year though his mom decided to get her a little phone, you can only make calls and texts to approved people etc. It just allows him some basic games that he can play. I've found that the phone though, is making my situation in particular a lot worse. The phone seems to set off my anxiety because instead of knowing that I had a specific date to pick my son up, I now have the ability to get text from her all the time which led to me catastrophizing. If he didn't text back stuff like that. How can I stop doing this. Even now? I'm shopping for Christmas presents and so I send him a couple messages asking if he like certain stuff. He didn't get a hold of me and I know in my heart everything is okay yet. My anxiety is going nuts and I feel like I'm going to have a f****** heart attack LOL. The thing is I really don't have any reason to think this either. His mom is a good mom. She's never done anything to put him in danger. There has never been a time that I've gone to pick him meaning up and him not being there. What can I do to stop myself from reacting this way? I also want to make it clear that while I get sad I do not take it out on them. I may send one or two messages but then I'll just sit and suffer in my house. I know this isn't good behavior on my part though. Why is it that if I know everything is okay, I still can't stop my body from experiencing the anxiety symptoms. Further more I don't want my son to think he did anything wrong. This isn't fair to him. Thanks for listening to my rant.

1pq79me,Has anyone had this experience with Tizanidine?,"Hey guys. Potential TW for medication side effects. Basically I’ve been taking 4mg of Tizanidine nightly for about a year. I feel like this has been my most anxious year yet and I’ve had chronic low level anxiety which isn’t super common for me. A few months ago I started having severe anxiety. Back in September I was prescribed a medication that I took for about a week that I discovered is a really bad medication to take with Tizanidine and I had a horrible reaction. I stopped taking that medicine abruptly and unfortunately lost the insurance to that provider. I have enough Tizanidine to get me through end of January and I’ve been taking it nightly. The last month or so I’ve been having panic attacks, and shakiness. I ended up getting sick last week and taking two consecutive doses in a row as well as benadryl over two days. So about 16mg in 2 days. Ever since then I’ve been having extreme, severe panic attacks. I’m waiting on the provider who prescribed these last year to call me tomorrow or Monday, but obviously I’m a bucket of anxiety and wanting to know if anyone else has had this experience? I was prescribed the tizanidine for a slipped disc in my back and through insurance changes I wasn’t able to go to physical therapy. The doctor said I can be on it for as long as I need nightly use and that there’s no side effects and it’s non addictive. I’m very concerned this is the thing that’s been giving me severe panic attacks because nothing else would be doing it. Can anyone share their experience or give feedback or support to get me through the next 24 to 72 hours?

Edit - The tizanidine doesn’t give me anxiety at night when I take it, but the next day when I wake up. When I take it at night I feel fine, but I’ve found myself having mood changes, shaking, and severe anxiety and panic attacks with no other cause during my waking hours.",1,7,2025-12-19 06:11:01,hexia777,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pq79me/has_anyone_had_this_experience_with_tizanidine/,anxiety,1.0,Medication,-0.9909,-0.06730295566502463,-0.6903597712516785,-1,-0.6559104767588442,-1

1ppxq95,"Taking meds feels like cheating, and doesn't fix anything, does it?","I am 54. I was a very timid kid, and over protected. I guess that's where the roots are. I was anxious about ""doing things right"" since very early, lest - haven't figured out yet what I dread(ed), being ridiculed, or scolded, or something like that.

At 16 I began being a heavy pot smoker. It gave me peace. Needless to say, as an everyday smoker at least until 30, it had its side effects. I stopped several times, and got back in.

I am married to a fantastic lady now 6 years, 10 years together. She doesn't tolerate weed. I quit. In the beginning things were all great.

But when I get triggered, and that's usually about performing anxiety (e.g. on the job, a difficult task, do a presentation, or anything like that), then my beautiful castle of a beautiful life I have, collapses, as I enter a downward spiral of anxiety, of which I am not able to get out without eventually resorting to meds.

But I am also a convinced naturalist, an adept and lover of life, and I can't get over the ""I should be able to get through this myself"", without any meds. I do exercise, I am relatively fit and healthy for my age (just a little belly), and do meditate - although I am sure I could do better there. I am wary of the self-help train, but my aspiration is and has always been to become a centered and realized being. Meds just don't fit in this view for me. How can I view myself as a fulfilled being, if I can not handle the anxiety-panic trigger and spiral?

Tried homeopathy and herbs but they don't really help, which is even more frustrating given my beliefs.

It's the main quest of my life. Already at 20, at my first wake up, I dreamt of becoming a natural healer, a plant medicine man, or maybe a guide for others. But I felt this latent anxiety and related issues wouldn't just go with this. How would I be able to help others, and promoting natural remedies, if I was not able to handle myself at all?

And so every time I have to resort to meds, it does calm me down, I feel better, but it feels like cheating, and it feels like cheating myself and all my beliefs. Apart from not liking the difficulty to wake up in the morning, and the somewhat notably lower libido.

So a new cycle begins, I take meds (usually I require low dosage), I get better, until after several months or so I feel so good I want to stop taking them and ""get through this myself and finally win this"".

After each cycle, I can feel how the meds didn't resolve anything, they just chemically act, and then immediately feel the absence of them (I do get off with some scaling down).

1pq5e43,mental health.,"hi everyone, i felt as if i was doing pretty decent anxiety wise, but, the last few days i felt like everything came crashing down around me…

i have been off of my daily anxiety medication (lexapro) since august. i was diagnosed these meds for anxiety and ocd, and, prior to this, i had been on 3 different anxiety medications since i was 12 years of age (i’m 20 now.) this is my first time coming off, and staying off of my daily medication. the only other mental health medication i take is klonopin, and that is only as needed (roughly two times a week.)

the last week or so, i’ve been noticing a few things that i haven’t noticed before, including… getting distracted easily, not wanting to finish tasks i used to enjoy (making tiktoks and edits, etc), staring off more especially while thinking, forgetting what i was saying more, jumbling words and sentences together more, having to reread words when reading posts, having to stop and think about what i’m saying more and not being able to do two things at once, there may be more, but, idk. 

i also noticed a few ‘not brain’ symptoms, like late at night, especially while driving, i’m seeing more shadows and things that aren’t there (not hallucinations, but, weird small flashes of light and different things.) and some tingling feelings in my ear/head… which makes me even more worried it’s something physical, or more ‘severe’ mentally…

i feel like these symptoms aren’t super major, and i tend to fix what i messed up quite fast, but, since i have health anxiety, i pick up on them more often, and my brain instantly thinks that there’s something more wrong with me (psychosis, schizophrenia, a tumor, seizures, etc) instead of just thinking it may be because i’m off of the lexapro.

sometimes i feel like my brain is faster than my mouth, which makes my words come out all jumbled and mixed up. i was diagnosed with ADD back in january, during an autism assessment test. i didn’t take this seriously because i felt as if the doctor was not professional, but, looking back on it now, i’m wondering if my lexapro (and the other medicines i’ve been on) masked the symptoms of ADD for me, and now that i’m off of it, the symptoms are here… it’s just confusing on why i’m noticing them now, 5 months after fully getting off of the meds… (when i first got off i was so so anxious and my ocd was at an all time high.)

i’m just definitely on the edge right now. i’m wondering if any of you guys have had any similar experiences? any advice is appreciated at this time. thanks in advance!",1,0,2025-12-19 04:46:13,sadielaplante,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pq5e43/mental_health/,anxiety,1.0,Advice Needed,0.8278,0.08938784803538903,0.0,-1,0.26621756960707776,1

1ppzjw9,Rabies ocd,"Hey!

So yeah i know this sounds weird, but since the 24th of November i have been dealing with anxiety about rabies. I will try to explain my situation. So its been 3 months since my potential exposure, i went together with my family and stayed at a hotel for about 2 nights. There in the hotel was a playful black cat, it was following me around for about 5 minutes. Later when i was sitting at a bench i lifted my left hand down and felt a cold maybe wet sensation, i got panicked and immediately looked at my hand, it was dark so i could not see any scratch or bite marks and no blood was visible, so i forgot about it after a couple of days. On the 24th of november i saw a tiktok video that said that even a small scratch could transmit rabies and thats when it all broke down on me, i started feeling the common symptoms (tingling at the bite, scratch mark), even got a fever i was scared to death and i tought i was gonna die, i started reading articles about patients and long incubtion periods, but eventually 10 days passed. Now its December 18th and im still alive, i went to a pshychologist and talked to her about my situation. Despite everything i still strugle, i always i think i have a fever and im tight in my chest all the time. I know my story seems stupid.

1pq4ugs,My body keeps rejecting food. Is this normal for anxiety?,"Back at the end of October, I had a severe anxiety/panic attack that brought on the worst pain I’ve ever felt. It was the first time it’s ever happened.

It felt like impending doom. **This all happened over 8 hours**. I was hospitalized and put on benzos. No doctor ever figured out what caused it. We just assumed I had food poisoning. 

Now, it keeps happening. Over the last few days, my body won’t stop going to the bathroom. I’m already underweight and feel like I’m losing so much weight from it and taking 1 mg of Klonopin a day is not helping. This is so scary and I have no idea what to do. It’s been two months and whenever I get anxious- my body repeats everything again. 

I’m so afraid to even eat anymore. I don’t even want to wake up. I’ve resorted to just plain white rice.

1ppeqv1,Has anyone tried Ativan ?,"(M33) I've been prescribed 1mg of Ativan (lorazepam) daily after my 2nd panic attack and 1st trip to the ER. I got the all clear on heart tests and was told I have anxiety. The Ativan seems to help, some days I would take 2mg if the anxiety symptoms were bad. 

I started to feel so much better that I decided to stop taking it as I thought maybe I was cured. Boy was I wrong and made a mistake, because the anxiety returned 2 days later and I almost went into another full blown panic attack. 

After reading many of your posts on here, I realized that I have health anxiety. After stopping the meds, I woke up in the middle of the night with the usual chest pain which kick started more anxiety and it spiraled from there. I took 2mg of Ativan and something to calm my stomach as I get nauseous as well. After 30mins I started to calm and chest pains went away.

Like many of you, I hate this so much as it seems to have started out of the blue and just won't seem to go away and when I feel perfectly fine mentally, I still get daily anxiety symptoms without meds.

Though I am approaching my 30's next year, I am ready to return to my home country and want to finally get a ""big girl"" job that isn't teaching related and I STILL don't know what that looks like- it doesn't help that the job market is terrible and difficult... I am lucky if I even get rejection letters these days. Some markets I am looking into are replacing people left and right with AI, too. 

So, for those who found the optimism, what did it take? I am ready to stop being scared of the future and just give myself a chance, but these things cycle through my head constantly and I just want to learn from those who also struggled.

1pq1xf3,Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia and Anxiety,"Hi everyone, 

  
I was recently diagnosed with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia a few days ago. In October and then again in November, I woke up to a heartrate of over 150. I went to the ER for palpitations a few days later, but they didn't find anything and referred me to a cardiologist. I went to a cardiologist and wore a Holter monitor for a week. Thankfully, the monitor caught a couple of these high heart rate episodes (160). These usually only used to happen in the middle of the night and now they're happening several times a night and now during the day. 

  
I've had very bad anxiety my entire life, along with OCD (in therapy and on lexapro, along with xanax as needed). I've also had a pretty stressful few years. However, I never had a high heart rate like this, even with severe anxiety. 

  
Now, it's at the point where I get these episodes daily. I get a rush of anxiety and my heartrate skyrockets to 130-150, then goes back down. My cardiologist said I don't even need to be treated since it's a benign condition, but she put me on propranolol because I have anxiety.

But I'm scared because this is happening more and more and I'm so sad. I've only taken 2 doses of my beta blocker (skipped yesterday and just took one). She gave me 20mg, but I only took 10mg. I had tachycardia in January because of an asthma flare. I had an echo on my heart, which came out fine. The cardiologist refer to the echo I did earlier because they say your heart wouldn't change that quickly and the holter monitor would show something. 

I was just working and felt fine today, then BAM, rush of anxiety, heartrate skyrockets, palms get sweaty, and I get tired. It went back down within a few minutes. That's when I stood up and took my beta blocker. I'm just so sad and defeated. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Can prolonged anxiety cause something like this?",1,0,2025-12-19 02:24:37,HahaRiceKrispy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pq1xf3/inappropriate_sinus_tachycardia_and_anxiety/,anxiety,1.0,Health,-0.3152,-0.02281481481481481,0.0,1,-0.09912296296296295,0

1pq1u5l,I'm not sure if to go to therapy for this. Just looking for suggestions.,"I try telling myself its fine. I feel sorry for even making it a big deal but it just doesn't change the fact stepping outside the house is already stressful. I hate it.  I also hate that I'm just now thinking about it. It makes me feel guilty. Like I shouldn't be making this a big deal.

I walk and as soon as a random stranger comes, I panic, I feel them looking at me, it LOOKS like they are looking at me. I tell myself 'Don't make weird faces. Don't walk weird. Are they looking at me. Am I making them uncomfortable.' I try convincing myself if I were to just relax, and realise everyone else is busy with their own life, I will be ok. But somehow that makes it worse. I end up looking at the ground, scrunching my face, my jaw tightens, my eyes don't know where to look. It's all about looking. Sometimes I stare at something so hard, I concentrate on it, as if nothing else existed, and I end up having headaches.

The worst is when there's a lot of people. I always feel lightheaded and I cant think but that's all. I'm just sick of living like this.

The problem really is my face. My posture. It's only been one semester into university and I've had 3 teachers ask me 'Are you okay?' or 'Are you angry' This has been a reoccurrence through all my life. I wanted it to stop so bad at uni but it seems to get worse. I cant talk to people while looking at them. Or talk to them properly without apologising or feeling like an asshole. Or replaying every single conversation or look.

Im already trying to start therapy. But for something else I thought/think is considered more serious. I don't know if to continue with that or be an asshole and tell them I want to change things.

About 4 weeks later, they are still there. I have had bloods done, seen 3 different doctors, and they all say its fine. 

Googling is still an issue. Stress from college is definitely taking a toll in me too. I don’t know what to do seriously. 

Do I go back? My nodes went really small, and then i started fidgeting with them again, and they feel inflamed again. Like. I just don’t know.

What should I do? I dont really wanna go back to the doctors over Christmas, but then if i dont, I wont be able to relax.

1powrb1,"Anxiety was the smoke, not the fire","
I want to share my story.
As far as professionals are concerned, I have a general anxiety disorder. Diagnosed at 33. Nothing before that. One period of “Stress” when I was 18 but that’s only because I wanted some time off work.


I could never put into words what I was feeling, from that very first “whoosh” at 33 which then caused panic. Like someone took my breath away and tilted everything 90 degrees for a split second and i disassociated. Those first 3 days I was a mess. Crying on the phone to my Doctor about what this was. Was I dying? Full impending doom!

Then years of being told its Anxiety. I guess it was but the Anxiety wasn’t the start of the river. The anxiety was further downstream. Something was causing this… fluctuation, causing me to be wired 24/7 and I tried everything. I studied my degree in Psychology, I had to reaffirm my identity. I wanted to understand myself so I delved into my past, my traumas, my mistakes. If this was anxiety then there was a cause, if I knew the cause then there was a solution. I wrote and I wrote and I wrote.

I jumped feet first into key life changing moments in my life. Finding out I was a donor baby. Losing my Mum. My marriage breaking down. Some childhood trauma events.

I tried every herbal remedy going. I read books on Vitamin D being the cause, Calcium, Magnesium, water intake needing to be more (a whole book on bloody water) Electrolytes. Books on B12, B6. K2. Potassium. Salt. Sunlight. Morning Sun, evening Sun, Circadian Rhythm. Sleep cycles, Lunar cycles

I got into breathing exercises. Pranayama, Nadi Shodhana, Self talking, self-soothing, self-parenting, birdsong, sounds of the forest. The sound of my own voice reassuring me. TRE- Trauma Releasing Excercising. Patting, Prodding, Yoga, High Intense Training. Mammalian Dive Reflex. Cold face packs.

 

Breathing! Breathwork. Facial muscle changes in Humans from processed soft foods. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, talking therapy, touch therapy, Hypnosis.

It became a perpential cycle. It became an obsession, a health anxiety in its own right. The search for the cause became the cause itself. It was a minefield. Just when I thought I’d mastered it, 2 days later I was back on my ass.

All of these things worked, a little. But only if I balanced all these things absolutely perfectly I could have a good day but there was too many variables and I’d never have two good days in a row. Maybe they worked because I wanted them to work, maybe they were placebo.

 

I became an expert in talking about identity. I was adamant it was linked to that with going through my own identity crisis a few years earlier. I talked about Identity like I had it all figured out. I didn’t and still don’t.

Diazepam was lovely but I’ve seen what a Benzo addiction looks like and I don’t want that. I was allowed 28 per year. Generally it was the only relief I got. Having to balance 28 blocks of 4 hour relief. 112 hours per year of relief.

I had the stigma of having Anxiety, the looks you get, the comments of being “weak”.

The huffs from people when you decline to do something. The empathy sometimes but also the disappointment in their eyes.

All the time I was going through this, I held down a job, I climbed my career although I’m known for being firey. I’m a good dad and believe in being a morally good person. I started a successful relationships but no one every described me as patient.
It took everything I had to not sit in the corner and rock. Exhausting is an understatement. The more I masked, the more it took out of me, the worse I was the next day.

it began to shape me. I was no longer care free. I was no longer the funny guy people knew me as. I was becoming bitter and defensive. The fear of it caused fear itself. The anxiety became about the anxiety.

 

It was getting worse, I had a full on panic attack trying to go into a theatre with my daughter, the shame I felt as a grown man that I couldn’t emotionally get through the door because I was crying and my 10 year old Daughter saw that. She didn’t know that I’d had “whooshs” all day and was already suffering even with Diazepam.


I found myself not wanting to go anywhere where I was trapped, either physically like a plane or socially at a theatre.
7 Years of being told I had anxiety. “You’ve got anxiety, some people just get it”
A few times I doubted myself, there was a period where I just accepted that I did have it. But it always sat at the back of my mind. “This is an imbalance of something, you’ve just got to find out what it is”

 

I started to rename it. I didn’t have Anxiety. I had an imbalance to my nervous system. My nervous system was firing constantly when no danger was present. It wasn't me that was broken, it was my nervous system.
Most of this was internal. I struggled internally a lot and wouldn’t tell anyone because to say it out loud would it give it a voice.

I felt like absolute shit and I didn’t know why. I would catatrophise on my own health. I would seem really impatient from an outside point of view and I would overthink things. They didn’t know that by the time we started talking at 10am, I’d already done a whole day of fighting and flighting.

 

Christmas was always a difficult time for me and when I consumed most of my Diazepam. The deadlines, the gifts, the parties, the foods, the alcohol, the responsibilities of being a parent and “is it enough”

 

Alcohol was a gamble. Sometimes it provided relief, sometimes it took a worst turn when I was already drunk. The hangxiety was terrible.

 

I was due a minor operation and in my pre-op I had my blood pressure taken but this time they took it seriously and kept me for an hour to see if it would go down. It didn’t. My highest on that day was 190/125.

I asked the consultant if this would explain anxiety and he answered in a way that made me feel like I’m an idiot for never even considering it.

Not once did I ever suspect High Blood Pressure was the cause. I’m a Healthcare professional and its constantly documented that Hypertension is a silent killer, no symptoms, no clues. 
Well it wasn’t so silent with me!
Every time I had my blood pressure taken, they marked it as White Coat Hypertension. They said things like “Oh that’s high, but you are nervous and you have just walked in here”
I never made the link because there is so little evidence out there that I’ve seen.

 

I’m 4 weeks into a new blood pressure tablet and I haven’t felt like this in 7 years.
To the point where I’ve even tried to internalise to see if the anxiety is in there and it isn’t.

I’ve gone out to dinner, a party, a work meeting with 40 people in one room with the exit on the other side. An Elevator and all at my worst time of the year. Nothing, not a quiver is there, no negative thoughts about being trapped. No dizziness, no surreal moments, no dissociation.

I actually felt nerves the other day. Like real nerves, butterflies in the stomach. Real nerves for a real situation. I haven’t felt that in years. Whenever I should have felt that, my body just dumped a shit tonne of adrenaline into my blood stream and then I’d crash a few hours after being an impatient dickhead.

I also felt thirst. Another thing I haven’t felt in years unless it was extreme. My body didn’t have time for these little introspective clues. It’s been fighting since 2018.


I feel like I have my life back and I’m incredibly proud of myself for living those 7 years on full flight or fight and still managing to hold a life together.
Although I am cold now. 7 years of constantly being too hot and adrenalated and now I'm out the other side, it's bloody freezing and I don't have the wardrobe for it anymore.

 

In hindsight. Yes, I do have Anxiety but only when my blood pressure is reading an average of 180/120.
On the bright side, at least I know how I act under enormous pressure. Incoherant, rushing everything at 90mph, dizzy and detached with the occasional crying episode. But I never ran or quit and i soooo wanted to.

I’m sharing this because I know how important it is to read success stories and to feel “seen”. To know there is a light at the end of the tunnel and for some, maybe Vit D is the reason. Maybe TRE will be the key to your trauma healing.

If I hadn’t had a proactive Doctor then I would have been on this path for years without finding the answer. I think our own Anxiety is worth exploring. Some times it is a physical reason. Other times we are our own worst enemy and the cause is our own internal thought pattern and coping mechanisms. 
Its about balance. Trying something new but not obsessing over it.


This is not an argument against anxiety. I lived it for 7 years and I felt it every god damn day, constant impending doom and my soul is tired but hopefully that door has closed now and I can continue to be an advocate for understanding it.
 
This is an argument for curiosity when it starts late and feels physical.


This might not be the end of it. I may be back in 3 months debating whether it's better to breath out for 4 seconds or 6 but it feels different this time and it's been miles longer than any previous attempt.

Keep going. There's always a light.",278,47,2025-12-17 19:09:37,shiftyT08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1powrb1/anxiety_was_the_smoke_not_the_fire/,anxiety,0.98,Recovery Story,-0.9994,0.03418371388959622,-0.5624331831932068,1,-0.5741998488186841,-1
1pq0vlj,Vibes and energy,I have a question. Does anyone here feel people vibes and energy. I am a introvert with social anxiety and I guess I feel more than a normal person. A majority of the times I can tell if a person has a negative vibes and energy before they even open their mouths. I went to a job interview today and as soon as I opened the door I felt this negative energy. That energy automatically made me assume I would not get the job I interviewed for. The person who Interviewed me wasn't friendly and told me nothing about the job which also made me assume I wouldn't be hired. I didn't really dress up and my hair is natural too with makes some people think it looks unkempt. Because it gets dry really easily. And these days people only go by what you look like and your looks will determine if a Job hire you or not so maybe they didn't like my look that's the impression I got. She said she would check my references and call me but I'm feeling like I'm not going to get a call back. But I've always felt negative vibes every since I was a teenager. I like doing homecare  homemaker companion work because I don't work around a lot of people like in a hospital or nursing home. I like working by myself because of my social anxiety.

1ppu5rg,SSRI’s causing visual snow,"Hi all, 

I’m currently on a range of different medications due to migraines and anxiety. I’m currently on 6mg Citalopram, 20mg Propranolol and 40mg Amitriptyline.

This is my 4th attempt in trying to wean off of Citalopram. My body seems to be extremely sensitive when trying to come off it, so I’m having to reduce by 2mg every 4 weeks (hence why I’m on the strange dosage of 6mg).

However, I’ve noticed since trying to wean off it that I have suddenly developed Visual Snow and my night vision has become significantly worse.

The other 3 times I’ve tried to wean off, I’ve felt extremely dizzy, spaced out and my vision has gone funny.

Has anybody else experienced any of this when trying to come off Citalopram, or any other SSRI? The visual snow is really affecting my mental health and I want it to go away.

1ppzcyw,How I Finally Fixed 3 Years of Chronic Chest Pain Caused by Breathing Mechanics,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my story because it took me three years to figure this out, and maybe it can help someone who’s struggling with something similar.

Background:

I’m 25 now, and this all started when I was 23. Out of nowhere, I began experiencing pain in my upper abdomen and chest. The pain was unexplainable and sometimes intense enough that I ended up in the ER. I went through all the tests — heart, lungs, everything — and was cleared for all structural issues. Doctors eventually told me it was chronic hyperventilation and generalized anxiety disorder.

For the next three years, I searched for a solution. I tried:

	•	Osteopaths

	•	Physiotherapists

	•	Breathing coaches

	•	Various antidepressants (like amitriptyline, paroxetine, etc.)

Nothing really worked, and I often felt dismissed or misunderstood. My pain persisted, and I developed muscle guarding, hypersensitivity in my chest, shoulder, rhomboids, and upper abdomen, and my nervous system felt constantly on high alert.

What I discovered:

After years of trial and error, I finally realized the root problem:

	•	I had been over-straining my diaphragm in a one-dimensional forward motion.

	•	This strained my upper stomach and front diaphragm, which then made my chest hypersensitive.

	•	The hypersensitivity triggered hyperventilation, which locked me into a pain-breathing loop.

	•	The front diaphragm was overused, while the lower thoracic region, ribcage, and posterior diaphragm were largely offline.

Basically, I was using my diaphragm like a piston, and every breath, every exhale, every time I tried to relax, reinforced this loop.

The solution:

The breakthrough came when I shifted the lead of my breathing from my diaphragm to my ribcage:

	•	Ribcage-led breathing: the ribs expand outward and slightly upward on inhale, collapse on exhale.

	•	Diaphragm follows naturally: this allows it to expand in a 360-degree motion, not just forward.

	•	Result: the chest, upper abdomen, and shoulders stop overcompensating, reducing hypersensitivity.

	•	Over time, this restores proper blood flow, reduces cramping, and normalizes the nervous system response.

Key insights:

	1.	Chronic pain like this doesn’t necessarily mean structural damage. It can come from maladaptive breathing patterns and overstrain.

	2.	Hyperventilation is not always the root cause — it can be a secondary effect of improper breathing mechanics.

	3.	Even small misconceptions about breathing mechanics can spiral into years of pain and anxiety.

	4.	Ribcage-first breathing retrains the body, restores load distribution, and allows the diaphragm to rest and function correctly.

Current status:

	•	My pain is decreasing.

	•	My chest and abdomen feel calmer.

	•	I can speak and breathe without over-straining.

	•	The “electric” tingling and hypersensitivity are slowly fading.

Why I’m sharing this:

Doctors and specialists led me astray with the assumption that my pain was psychosomatic. The reality is, the body remembers and reacts to years of hyperventilation and mechanical misalignment, and the fix is often mechanical, not purely medicinal.

If you’ve had similar chronic chest/upper abdominal pain, look closely at your breathing mechanics — not just anxiety or hyperventilation. Sometimes the body is signaling that it’s overworked in subtle ways.

I know how scary it can be, even if you get cleared by professionals numerous times. All this time i was just breathing wrong.

1ppybh3,What to expect from taking Diazepam?,"Hi there!

I have a super big fear of needles and blood tests and I have to get a blood test tomorrow, so I talked to my doctor and he prescribed me just 1 Diazepam tablet. I have very bad anxiety and my head is going wild trying to expect whats going to happen with me taking it, so I'm just wondering if anyone could share what it's like?

My biggest fear is that it's not going to work. I've never been on any sort of medication before, and I've never touched Diazepam before. So logically I know that it probably will work, but peoples bodies work differently!

My second biggest fear is that I'm going to panic, even though I've taken the medication. Last time I tried to have a blood test, I had a massive panic attack and got sent to hospital, where I also couldn't go through with the blood test. I'm scared this is going to happen again, and with it being so close to Christmas, I won't be able to rebook it for a while and I need this done ASAP.

I'm not someone who can switch off and distract myself from anxiety (I've tried, trust me!!) so I'm hoping that someone just sharing their experience will help ;'')

1ppx6c3,How can I manage anxiety in a new job?,"Looking for advice

So, I need some advice/reassurance I guess. I have found out yesterday that my contract will not be extended past the probation period. I was a bit confused by this, as I have had a talk with my manager regarding what I can improve about a week and a half ago and have tried to implement it and there was no concrete reason as to why and nobody wanted to provide me any feedback as to why. A lot of the written feedback I would get on tasks was positive and there were minor things to improve. I also asked my line manager for a feedback conversation last week and was told that I am doing great and that I should not be that hard on myself. I guess I struggled a bit because they hired other people at the same time as me for the same role and we would often compete for tasks and there was often not enough for all of us to do, so we would either message people asking if we can help them or did training. I did mess up some stuff, such as email formatting and such, which my manager would explain to me but I was so anxious at this point I misunderstood her and did not include the highlighting she wanted. I knew I was making mistakes and had a lot to improve on but I can honestly say I tried really hard and thought I still can, given I was only there for two months.

1ppgkdq,derealization panic attacks,"ive never used reddit before, i dont even know where to start or even describe whats happening to me.

i get random bursts of not feeling real at all. its a very scary feeling all around like right after you get scared and my vision throbs and spins like when you get dizzy. i feel lightheaded and my mind races to where i cant think. it is very horrible to me, as if amplified. 

i cant focus and i tend to panic even more when it happens, even though i try to acknowledge it and let it pass. they usually only last a few minutes and it feels like the longest minutes of my life. (when i get this i know there is more to come, its like a warning) then it turns into episodes where i have it back to back every few hours. it makes it very hard to do daily things, even waking up. in october, it was terrible. i didnt go to school for a few weeks and i had it back to back. it felt like it worsened every day. i didnt shower or brush my teeth because i was afraid of it happening while i did it. i had even tried to take my own life so it didnt happen again.

i havent had it in a year but today it came out of nowhere when i was talking to my brother for what felt like 10-15 minutes. a few days ago i had it for a few seconds. i hate it so much. 

is there any medication that would help get rid of this at all? i dont want to deal with it or try to go through it again. im so afraid itll happen again while im at school and im debating on staying home.

no one at home understands what its like. ive tried going to the doctors but they look at me like im crazy. i dont even know how you would get diagnosed with something like this and it ruined my chances on going to the military because i thought it was finally over.

1pptmvi,Speech problem or anxiety?,"Does anyone else ever experience having difficulty saying “s” words during social interactions? This honestly started out recently for me.

Quick history: When I was younger, I had an interdental lisp that I was trained to correct. But in recent months, I’ve had several bite/misalignment issues due to dental problems. A few days ago, my coworker pointed out my weird way of saying “s”. Because of my history and my GAD + panic disorder + health anxiety diagnoses, of course I hyperfixated on it.

Since then, I can’t seem to pronounce words with “s” the way I used to do. It sounds lispy again, and my tongue just ends up tripping over words with “s” in it. It honestly made me believe I may have some terrible disorder (especially since my dad passed away from bulbar ALS), but today I tried wearing a face mask and my “s” words significantly improved. I still say it with a lisp sometimes, but I found that it doesn’t bother me as much? So it made me wonder if this is just a social anxiety thing and something I was hyperfixating on so it sounds weird. I don’t know.

1ppoej2,How to believe things will get better,"I've learned in therapy to challenge my negative thoughts, and to reframe them. The problem is, I can think of more positive thoughts, but I don't believe them. How can I convince myself to believe them?

For example: currently my worst thought is that I'm afraid things will never get better, that I'm hopeless. So I'm trying to tell myself that that's the depression/anxiety talking, that thousands of people have felt this way and yet gotten better, that I myself have dealt with hard times and things did get better.

But then my mind goes: that's all different, you've never been in a situation like this and this particular situation won't get better. You're depression/anxiety is worse than those of other people. Etc.

So how can I make myself believe in more positive thoughts?",2,1,2025-12-18 16:50:13,Alsoeve1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ppoej2/how_to_believe_things_will_get_better/,anxiety,1.0,Advice Needed,-0.5848,0.0565340909090909,-0.5389354228973389,-1,-0.43360089326685125,-1
1ppodfj,Anyone else feel “full” and gag when eating out because of anxiety?,"I’m not sure how to explain this, but I’m hoping someone can relate or give advice. Whenever I eat out with friends or other people, I suddenly feel full after just a few bites. My throat tightens, I get a lot of phlegm, and swallowing feels hard, like I might gag.

The weird part is this never happens at home, especially when I’m just eating with my dad. I can eat normally then. It only happens when I’m outside, especially if I feel pressure (like when someone paid for my food).

This started happening right after I moved to Japan. I was surprised by how big the food portions are here, and since then eating out has become stressful for me. Once the thought “I can’t finish this” pops into my head, my body reacts immediately — and it usually ends up being true. I’ve been to a lot of restaurants, and most of the time I really couldn’t finish my food. Because of this, I’ve actually gotten thinner.

It’s really frustrating and makes eating out hard to enjoy.

On the second night I took another pill and slept well. I felt pretty good and happy that night.

On the morning of day 3 I started to have problems. In the morning my anxiety went through the roof, giving me intense OCD and compulsion. I was pacing around my house. Felt horrible. Couldn’t relax.

I was told to take another dose. I had been prescribed 3x’s a day and I was only taking 1. They said the blood levels were inconsistent and it was causing me rebound issues.

So yesterday I took 3, spaced throughout the day. Last night I barely slept. I am now off work and not able to function due to anxiety and cognitive issues.

I think I do the correct thing yet I will call myself naive like I am not ready for this world, then I do something not so correct and feel like the worst person in the world and the guilt eats me alive for weeks.
Immediately after I make a decision I start thinking of other ""better options"" I could've done instead, why is my brain always working against me and when does it end??? I don't know what to do, I have never taken meds before, I don't know if that would fix this.

1pppxhz,Colonoscopy,"I have a colonoscopy Monday. I can't reschedule bc it's the only opening until I lose my health insurance 🙃

I have a LOT of anxiety over all of it. 
1) the actual colonoscopy....mainly the being out under part I've been reassured by many it's not too bad. I plan to ask them if they can play music or if I can wear my headphones during it & I am gonna see if I can bring my eye mask. Whenever I can reduce other factors (sight, smell,
Sound) it reduces anxiety. 

2) losing my health insurance...I just battled this in August...finally got a plan in October & now back to no idea what I'm going to do. I was experiencing a lot of weird health symptoms so I've been to a slew of docs & appt since August. I luckily only owe like $400 in medical debt right now but my biggest concern is meeting with my therapist. The plans I could qualify for she doesn't accept at the moment. I know I could find another one but iykyk when you find the ONE you don't want to let them go!! I'm trying to get out of fiancial debt rn but am thinking about opening a credit card to use for appts & then pay off asap. 

That's causing me more anxiety than I'd like to admit & if the colonoscopy shows anything...then what? More medical debt? Just ugh. 

3) Lastly, this is minor but there's a Christmas event that I REALLY wanted to take my kid too. I've been anticipating it ALL month. My mom is off work to watch my youngest, my husband is off work to go with us & the weather is decent....but if I go through with colonoscopy Monday I can't go bc I have to do prep Saturday & Sunday 🥲 the event is almost 2 hrs away. I haven't told her yet so she won't be totally disappointed but changing plans really triggers my anxiety and I don't want her to miss this.

So I'm currently in a spiral. Do I miss the event & do the colonoscopy so it's covered by insurance? 

Do I go to my moms Friday night , stay the weekend & go home Sunday so my husband can take my oldest to the Saturday event & my mom can hang with my youngest while I prep? 

Do I just say fuck it all and cancel it all and just go & enjoy the event?! 

OR...is the colonoscopy being scheduled and us missing the event a plan to keep us safe from something 🙃 this one is trying to rule my brain 

So yea.....any advice , tips , whatever let me know

1pppol0,"Those who used to experience anxiety symptoms when speaking in public, how do you overcome it?

But the point is, something simple like  answering professor's question out loud is enough to make me experience those symptoms. When my head is shaking, i can't stop it, outside it's not too prominent to notice, but i can feel it strongly, does anyone experience the same symptoms?

  
Eventhough i tried to slower my breath, exhale and inhale thoroughly, but it didn't seem to fix much. I think that because when i was younger, i was not the kid that can express my thought out loud, and the inexperience of spontaneous speaking and public speaking that made me anxious when it comes to expressing myself.

Should I wait this out? Since it started up suddenly maybe it will disappear as quickly? Or should I speak to someone?

1ppowp8,"Anxiety, night sweats and weight loss","23, female. I have horrible health anxiety. I spend the whole day worrying so much I can’t do anything else. The worst thing is that after an extreme flare up at the end of last year which sent me into a psych ward after 2 weeks of a non stop panic attack which couldn’t be stopped, it got so much better. I slowly started to have a fairly normal life again. As normal as it can get with severe anxiety. I never experienced this kind of anxiety before. Excruciating, crushing anxiety 24/7. But I did it. It got better even without medication. Until this year. University started in September and since then it got really bad again. 

I spend the whole day worrying, I can’t put my mind at ease, I can’t do anything without being worried. It started with stomach issues, fast transit time, soft stool… it sent me spiraling again. It’s so inconsistent, some days I get soft stool and later that day everything is normal again. Some days my anxiety is high I get stomach issues, sometimes I don’t. I’ve been having similar issues when I was studying but after that it stopped. 
What’s causing me the most concern is weight loss and night sweats (?). I’ve been losing about 3-4 kg (6.7-8.8 pounds) since September, I don’t know if I’ve been eating less, I eat about 1 to 2 meals a day but I thought I did that before I was losing as well? Maybe I’m snacking less? I tend to lose my appetite with anxiety, I lost 5 kg (11 pounds) in 3 weeks last year but gained it back when feeling better but back then I hardly ate anything, now I’m eating but still losing. I even ate more one week but still lost weight, although on some days I forget to eat completely.
Some nights I also sweat lightly. It’s almost every night for about a month, some nights no sweat at all. I wake up multiple times per night and about one of these times I notice im sweating a bit. My clothes are slightly damp where I lie on the mattress, not soaking tho. I’m also a bit hot when it happens. I also used to wake up with one of my hands numb, I think it could be nocturnal panic attacks but I’m scared of something more serious. I rarely sweat so this is new to me.
Also my temperature is the highest in the morning and lowest in the evening which is weird but no fever, temperature is normal. Maybe because my sleep rhythm was really bad til last week, I went to sleep in the morning and woke up in the evening.

I’m so scared of cancer I don’t know what to do, I’m so scared of going to the doctor. 
Does this sound very concerning? I had blood works, brain mri, ecg and blood pressure readings last November and January. Everything was normal then.
It’s so hard living with this, maybe someone has some advice or experienced something similar.
I’m sorry for the rant, I just need to get this off my chest. Thank you so much for reading all this.

1ppdtsn,"I highly recommend the book ""Don't Panic: Taking Control of Anxiety Attacks""","Just wanted to say this book literally changed my life since I started reading it yesterday, I feel more at ease then I have in over a year and a half honestly. The book's approach is somewhat different from other self-help books in that it encourages you to confront and embrace your fears rather then running from them or trying to distract yourself, it sounds counter-intuitive but hot damn does it work. I was worried I was going to need meds(no judgement for those who do need them, I was just concerned about side effects and potentially getting addicted to them)or expensive therapy, but this book saved me from myself.

1ppo4wl,How to stop/taper off beta blockers?,"I wish there was a different sub for such a widely used medication but there isn't, so I am having to ask here.

So, I have been taking propranolol for the last 3 years, for my anxiety and palpitations caused by stomach issues. My GP prescribed it to me without mentioning anything about its long term effects especially rebound/withdrawal symptoms.

I am now on 20mg LA and want to taper it down but as I tried to come down to 10mg, I was having resting heart rate of 130 which panicked me into thinking what if it goes further high so I rushed to take the dose again. 

So I have questions:
1. Has anyone been able to completely stop them after taking for a long term(>2 years) ? 

This is my biggest fear because I have read stories of people sharing how they feel sudden high heart rate even >2 weeks after stopping them.

2. Can long term use of this medicine cause real damage/sensitivity to the heart? 

3. How did you taper it off??

I know most people who recover don't come back on the reddit but if any of you who did it and reading this, kindly help.

We need such positive stories to have some hope.

1ppmzqv,Choosing Between My Degree and My Wellbeing,"Hi, I'm a 20-year-old university student (UK-based). I am currently doing my first year of social work, and previously did about 1/3 of a year of mental health nursing when I was 19, after leaving as I felt it wasn't right for me. I have had bad mental health all my life, really ever since I was about 6 years old and tried to commit suicide through means of overdose when I was 16 due to being really depressed.

My depression has gotten better, but my anxiety is still really high, which confuses me, as I don't remember feeling this anxious when doing mental health nursing. It just feels like my anxiety has shot up recently and won't really go back down. Maybe it's because I need to adjust to uni life again, or I don't know. I am thinking about dropping out as I am constantly having tension headaches and chest pain. I've had approximately 4 panic attacks in the space of a month, which is very odd for me as I don't normally get panic attacks. I also recently injured my throat 2 weeks ago, which has led to shortness of breath and general discomfort/pain in my throat all the time, as well as my not being able to eat anything.

I can go to Wellbeing at my university, but there is a limited number of things they can do due to me being on a programme like social work as it ahs highly professional and has an attendance requirement of 80%, so i cant really be missing too many days and have already missed 2 weeks due to constant chest pains and then my throat injury coming along.

My parents want me to finish my degree as it has really good opportunities in the UK and upward mobility, which, if anyone from the UK is reading this, knows how tough the job market is now. My parents also have a considerable lack of mental health knowledge, so they don't even believe that I am mentally ill or have ever been mentally ill, despite being diagnosed by psychiatrists. I'm really conflicted. I just don't know what to do, leave, and I become a failure and am unlikely to get a job for at least a couple of months, or stay and keep suffering and feeling like I'm going to drop dead from an aneurysm or another suicide attempt.

1ppgvyz,is therapy worth it,"i’m not trying to self diagnose but it’s pretty obvious i’m a hypochondriac. for the past 5 ish months ive been very very worried about my health, mainly my heart (started after a massive panic attack i got from reading the news, genuinely thought i was having a heart attack, scariest moment of my life). every time it feels weird or it raises slightly i feel sick and scared. blood clots and seizures and stuff like that have been a big thing for me too, tends to be just stuff you’ve got no idea is going on that scares me.

 whats weird is most things don’t give me anxiety like school and work, yk the normal things.

anyway, it’s gotten tamer but it’s still kinda exhausting. i’m not gonna explain the entire sensation of the “anxiety attack” but just imagine the couple of seconds before you throw up and if it happened right after running a mile. 

although i know that therapy is definitely the best thing for me, i just can’t be arsed and i don’t rlly like telling ppl about my mental health. i suppose the “be a man” mentality has gotten to me, but i just kinda don’t want people to know how i feel.

1ppiixe,Caffeine,"Hi I’m new to this sub! Needing some advice. 

For background: I know I don’t tolerate caffeine that well. I’ve had many instances where coffee makes me shake and extremely anxious, but, I’ve also had moments where I drink coffee and am completely fine. Anyway, I don’t drink coffee that much, if I’m in the mood for a beverage, I’ll have a matcha. 

This brings me to now. I just got a job at an energy drink company and I’ve never had one before (which is completely fine). Since I’ve started, I’ve been very curious on trying one of the drinks just to see what they taste like. I know I’ve had some bad moments with caffeine, but I was doing some research and saw that a large coffee from dunkin/starbucks is about the same amount of caffeine that’s in the energy drinks (200mg), if not more. So today I finally caved and tried one. I didn’t finish it by any means, I had about half (maybe less than that honestly). I felt relatively fine all day until now. It’s midnight and I am SO anxious and my stomach is in knots. It’s a very similar feeling to what I’ve experienced when I’ve had anxiety attacks after coffee. And not I’m just stressing about how I need to wake up early for work tomorrow and I can’t seem to calm down. With that being said, I’d appreciate any advice anyone has!

1pplpnt,My Story.,"In the summer of 2025, around June time, I went on an girls holiday for two weeks. It was amazing, first girls holiday as a 22f felt great. However, the second week in things changed. I had a huge panic attack, something I never experienced before. I felt like I couldn’t feel my heart beat, struggled to breathe, chest was in immense pain. I literally thought I was dying and tried to take myself to the hospital. No drugs, very little alcohol and on this night completely sober. The girls talked me out of going to hospital and explained it was anxiety yet it was so hard to believe. I had to sleep in bed with them because I thought I was going to die. Then for the following week that was my life, I’d wake up in panic and feel panic all day. I was having intense intrusive thoughts about my mind taking over my body and harming myself when I knew I didn’t want to do that. I’m not suicidal, I don’t want to self harm. But these thoughts of what ifs? Took over me. I was so scared on my own mind. When arriving home, my mam picked me up and took me straight back to our family home where I stayed permanently. About a week after my chest still hurt but things started to settle and eventually I was fine again. Then, 6 months later (now) I take a walk with my boyfriend and by the time we get back home my intrusive thoughts completely take over again. I can’t understand a trigger, but it’s been two weeks now and things don’t feel like they’re getting better. Harmful thoughts, when I’m in them o can get out of them. I’m too scared to get up when I have these thoughts incase something does happen to me. Impending doom constantly, scared of dying young, scared of doing something to myself. I’m literally scared all the time. I went to a doctor’s, they prescribed 28 tablets of promethazine. I take one when I feel it coming on and it goes mellow me slightly but I just don’t feel like myself. I feel like I’m in a dream constantly wanting to feel the outside again. I then met with a mental health nurse yesterday and she mentioned putting me on Citalopram (I think) and that a doctor would contact me to talk about it. The doctor then contacted and explained you need an ecg due to the effects and such and he would rather me fluoxetine. Now I’ve been on fluoxetine before, about 4 years ago when I was extremely suicidal. I didn’t give it much of a chance but it’s hard to have faith in this route due to have I used to feel. Anyone have any advice or suggestions? I’ve always been at battle with my mental health, and I feel like I’m constantly pawned off to the point I just stop it all and try get over it. I had a very almost successful attempt 4 years ago, and I do believe my fear of death comes from that due to not been giving any therapy afterwards. Just pawned off to my own devices again. So I just need to know if people can come out of this and these things actually work because I feel so scared and helpless.

it kind of all culminated when last monday my tooth broke. it broke to show a huge cavity inside it and i freaked the fuck out!!! i had panic attacks on and off all from last monday through last thursday. last thursday i got it x-rayed and the dentist said its saveable. thankfully, its not infected or anything. i’ve just never had a procedure done before and im super nervous.

i was able to not have any panic attacks in the office because i took some klonopin before i went. it was like a miracle!!! but instead of being a 30 minute appointment/consultation, now this one will be two hours… im so scared that i wont be able to sit still for that long or something. i have pretty severe agoraphobia too so the battle for me basically lays in being able to stand being out of the house itself.

1pphjtb,How to overcome cardiophobia / severe health anxiety?,"Hi everyone,
I’m a 28-year-old male and I’ve been struggling for several months with severe cardiophobia (health anxiety focused on the heart).

I’ve had multiple medical evaluations: ECGs, echocardiograms, blood tests including troponin — all normal. Doctors keep reassuring me that my heart is fine and that this is anxiety-related.

Despite this, I experience:
	•	Chest pain (often left-sided or retrosternal)
	•	Arm discomfort
	•	Dizziness
	•	Sweating
	•	A constant fear that I’m missing a hidden heart condition

What makes it harder is:
	•	I had a myocarditis when I was 17, with full recovery and no sequelae
	•	A family member had coronary disease later in life, which fuels my fear
	•	Even when I exercise and feel fine, my brain keeps doubting the reassurance

I intellectually understand the tests are reassuring, but emotionally I can’t let go. I keep scanning my body and catastrophizing every sensation.

For those who’ve been through this:
	•	What actually helped you recover?
	•	Therapy (CBT, exposure, hypnosis)?
	•	Medication?
	•	Any practical strategies to stop reassurance-seeking and bodily hypervigilance?

I really want to get my life back and stop living in fear of my heart.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to respond.

1ppl7fr,How can I approach my social anxiety?,"Hi. I (F23) have developed social anxiety pretty badly and want to start getting back out into the world and do things (not necessarily because I want to, but I would like to go to college). I was wondering for those who have experienced social anxiety or SAD what helped you to reintroduce yourself into social life? Is there any way I can curb my fears, such as public speaking, being judged, and/or reaching out? I have a hard time maintaining eye contact, starting conversations and often miss certain social cues. I grew up both socially isolated and sheltered so I have a hard time with anything social at all. I'm also extremely independent and hate asking for help (oddly enough I'd rather ask strangers than my family with this.) My anxiety has only gotten worse after being wrongfully terminated from my last job; I've mainly just been at home since. I've also been using AI to chat with in my free time (I have little to no friends, RIP). I know I probably need to stop with the AI chats. . . How can I wean myself back into the public?

1ppffe3,How long does a “panic attack hangover” last?,"Just a little background:

I had a pretty bad almost 2 week long panic attack around Thanksgiving over college finals and I feel like it completely changed me as a person. The only thing keeping me going was the fact I would pass my classes and the semester would be over soon, but here we are a week later and I still feel weird. 

It’s almost like my brain is empty? I used to daydream and make up stories almost every hour or the day for fun but I can barely hear my thoughts, it’s like there is a veil over that part of my brain. All I can really ”think” of is things I’m reading or what I am currently anxious about. I’m really not used to that. 

Another thing is my mind is now trying its best to stay in a state of anxiety. I was always pretty good about not breaking down over the future/bad current events but that’s all I can really think about. Distracting myself with posts online works ok but it’s inevitable I’ll come across something that gets me worked up. 

  
Is there any way to get myself back to normal anytime soon? Doctors aren’t an option just yet and I’m kinda fearful of the side effects of popular supplements. I’ve also tried to get more sleep but the most I can do is 5 hours with a killer cortisol waking response.

The ""Proprioceptive"" Anchor: a heavy scarf or a tight-fitting jacket. The pressure on your skin tells your nervous system where your body ends, reducing the ""floaty/scared"" feeling.

1ppi0bb,Tips for Recent Chronic Anxiety,"Hey all, I don’t really use Reddit, but wanted to reach out to people who might have had similar issues in the past on how they have been able to break from a chronic cycle of anxiety.

I am a 34 y/o male who has had issues with hypochondria based anxiety since college. I have always been pretty in-tune with my body and tend to notice any time something doesn’t feel exactly right. This can lead into cycles causing a panic attack and a trip to the ER. 

When I was in my mid 20s I was able to overcome this in large part by simply accepting mortality and saying that I will just live my time on the planet and if something bad happens there is nothing I can do and to move on. Unfortunately now I am in my mid 30s and I live a different life. I have a wife and two amazing kids aged 1 and 5. This has completely broken my previous coping mechanism as I am now can’t fathom not being there for my kids as they grow up.

About two or so weeks ago I had a coworker of mine suddenly die from a stroke. It reminded me of mortality again, and when I got vertigo for the first time a few days later, my anxiety kicked into overdrive. The doctor at the ER that night took an EKG and said that it was just vertigo and I should be good to go. Unfortunately I then have noticed tons of little symptoms, and started into a bad cycle of symptoms that all are typical of anxiety, but as people on this group probably know, it’s hard to know for sure.

As a result I have been in a spiral the last two weeks where I see everything as a symptom and despite my conscious brain knowing the odds are low, my subconscious brain keeps worrying that it could be a tumor or something else serious. This has resulted in a few trips to the ER for different symptoms that has eventually led to me getting an MRI yesterday to get checked out. My doctor doesn’t think they will find anything, but I have continued having panic symptoms and now that I am awaiting the results of the MRI I can barely function. 

Seeing as this could be a week before I hear anything, does anybody have any tips that have worked for them in the past to break themselves out of a cycle of Anxiety? I try to avoid WebMD for obvious reasons and on the doctor side I was given a pill that is not overly effective, and scheduled for a therapy session. Unfortunately therapy is booked out a very long time in my area so I am not going to be able to address that anytime soon. I am also medicated as well, but have the same issues trying to adjust my meds.

Any suggestions or comments are appreciated. I can definitely tell that just putting this all down on paper has helped a little, but am still a ways away from being fully functioning again.",1,0,2025-12-18 10:11:50,VanDykeConnor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ppi0bb/tips_for_recent_chronic_anxiety/,anxiety,1.0,Advice Needed,-0.989,-0.0025717963953258006,0.0,-1,-0.29721435927906514,-1
1ppdf2d,Antibiotics are an unexpected nightmare,"I'm on day 3 of amoxicillin after being diagnosed with a sinus infection. Had a nasty cold, got a CT scan and I guess my sinuses were looking pretty inflamed. This is the first time I've taken antibiotics since I was a teenager, I'm 31 now.

It's been a pretty miserable experience, not gonna lie. My stomach aches like hell and my anxiety is through the roof. I'm relatively fit, my resting heart rate is usually between 55-70 BPM, but now it's anywhere between 80-95. Then if I get up or literally do anything, it jumps up to 100-120.

My appetite is completely gone, I've been trying to eat things like greek yogurt to help with my gut biome, but anytime I eat I get crazy nausea. 

I have pretty severe health anxiety and so despite having two very normal ECG (and normal blood work) over the last few days I'm still dreading having some kind of heart attack or something terrible.

1pp7lan,Health anxiety is making me crazyyy,"I deal with health anxiety and anxiety in general since I was a little kid and I’ve been going through a bad health anxiety episode since I found out I have anisocoria in October, I ended up getting an mri and there’s nothing wrong with my brain and eyes, it’s just physiological pupil asymmetry, I thought getting this out of the way would end my anxiety but it didn’t. 

I just found new things to worry about in the process like:

\\-chest discomfort and spitting blood while brushing my teeth. I immediately diagnosed myself with lung cancer but it was just muscle tension from anxiety and bleeding gums since I wasn’t brushing my teeth properly from avoiding looking at the mirror for weeks (I’d get an anxiety attack every time I looked at my pupil asymmetry in the mirror so I decided to avoid it at all costs)

\\-some eye floaters only on my right eye, i thought I was having a retinal detachment since I’m only 18 so it couldn’t be from old age, literally forced myself to see them constantly and tried super hard to “see” the other signs of it too.

\\-tinnitus. One time I was extremely anxious, got up, lost balance for a bit and heard ringing in my ears for like 2 minutes or less. It never happened again other than just hearing it for literal seconds once in a while, but for a whole week I thought I was hearing a scary beeping sound from the inside of my ears, today I found out it was my charger making those noises…

This is a never ending cycle, I feel trapped in my own head, it’s hard to leave the house because of the sense of impending doom. The thought of going crazy makes me panic even more lol! It’s really hard to stop obsessively googling every single symptom, my search history looks so crazy 😭😭

1pp71yy,Chronic weird/ insecure sensation at the top of my head after wearing hats everyday for 7 years,"30 year old male
 I have been desperately struggling with this feeling at the top/ front of my head for some years. Almost like the sensation at the top/front of my head has atrophied/ become stuck/ feels like a solid object/ almost as if I have dissociated from feeling there and there is just a numbness/self-objectification / hyper self-consciousness of this part of my head. It feels like I can no longer feel the boundary of my head properly here, which has created a huge amount of distress for me in recent years as, since my head can longer sense a secure boundary, is reacting compulsively in a threat/ stress response primarily to visual phenomena in my environment that this part of me is sensing as potentially dangerous. This is particularly bad while I’m driving, such as driving under bridges/signs passing overhead creating this visceral stress response and reinforcing the tension at the top of my head to the point of immense weariness. It’s as though there is a weight or invisible object attached to the top of my head that I don’t know how to either let go of or integrate into the felt sense of my own body as a whole, yikes. For context, I have dealt with pretty bad OCD/ anxiety starting in my early twenties that I believe was triggered by cosmetic surgeries I had on my ears twice as a teenager, coupled with smoking weed (hunch), that left me feeling hypervigilant about my ears/head/body as a fragile object that I had to protect/ ‘hold onto’. Eventually I got over the ears, but unfortunately at this time, around age 22, became obssessed/ possessed by fear of hair loss to the point of phobia/dysmorphia. It was as if the ocd/ dysmorphia triggered by the ear surgeries transferred to my hair, objectifying it as a fragile object. To deal with this, and as a kind of ‘safety blanket’, I started wearing hats everyday for pretty much every waking moment, which has continued for the last 7 years. The feeling at the top of my head, along with horrible threat/stress reactivity while driving only got bad 3/4 years ago, only reinforcing my feeling of self-conscious and desire to wear hats to cover up / protect this insecure feeling at the top of my head. Could this feeling at my head possibly be related to always wearing a hat/ desensitizing the neurons there? Or is it more likely my ocd/ dysmorphia about my hair? Multiple times I’ve tried shaving my head/ accepting my hair and ditching the hats; but the feeling of insecurity and vulnerability is so powerful and uncomfortable that the hat addiction always swiftly returned. Sorry this was long. This ridiculous ordeal has been slowly destroying me for a long time and I really am hoping for some unbiased opinions.

1pow5lo,My brief guide to temporary - long term alleviation of physical symptoms,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for most of my conscious life and for a long time, I didn’t realise it was anxiety. I’m sure a lot of people can relate to that. 
What has remained is my physical reaction following or preceding bouts of anxiety; perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of anxiety, for me at least.
As I’ve built up techniques and such over the years, I figured I’d share them. I really hope that this post can give at least one person some relief, if not provide a post for people to discuss their own techniques :) 

1. Vapour Rub / Peppermint Oil (or peppermint smelling things like toothpaste) / Lavender / Rubbing Alcohol
Good for: Stomach, throat and chest symptoms. 
What a LIFE SAVER. As someone who has a very intense sense of smell, I find smells that are either positively nostalgic (like vapour rub, and the memories of taking a sick day off of school and watching YouTube while it rains outside) or just calming for my body (like peppermint or lavender) to be helpful in grounding. Intense smells such as the eucalyptus/methanol of vapour rub or peppermint can actually help you feel the sensation of air hitting the back of your throat. This can be very assuring if you suffer from throat tightness, globes sensations or feelings of discomfort when breathing. This (for me, at least) can have a run-off affect for my chest tightness, and help alleviate that. Rubbing alcohol and peppermint have also helped with nausea; this is very old knowledge that was used by many generations of people. Don’t knock it till you try it ! 

2. Ginger tea / lollies / pickle / …raw?
Good for: Stomach symptoms
Classic. Any form of ginger has been known to calm the stomach, especially as you feel an acidic bubbling. Typically relief is within 5/10 mins, but this can vary. My preferred forms are: ginger tea (around 2x2inch piece of peeled ginger root with a squeeze of lime juice, a piece of lime and honey as desired), ginger lollies (gin gins are amazing and come in many different strengths… the extra strong is my fav!) pickled ginger (yes, the type you often get with sushi) or even raw (small, small amounts to start. This is a desperate measure!) 

3. Breathe in.. and then breathe some more!
Good for: throat and chest symptoms.
Massive credit to whoever posted this on reddit some years ago. It’s a technique I can’t live without when my respiratory symptoms play up. Here’s what you do: breathe in through the nose, all the way until your chest feels like it’s filled with air. Then, take one more big SNIFF. Then, breathe out through the mouth. I often feel instant relief, but rinse and repeat as needed! 

4. Heat packs / hot showers 
Good for: stomach, throat and chest symptoms.
Heat on areas that feel tense or cramping can often provide near immediate relief. This can also feel like a grounding sensation, which is particularly good when paired with breathing techniques. 

5. Legs up ladies!
Good for: head symptoms.
So, one night I went to a concert. I decided that eating beforehand wasn’t in my best interests, and well, I collapsed towards the end. Thankfully, I fainted surrounded by a group of nurses! (If there’s any chance you are seeing this, I’m still grateful, and I really hope I don’t ruin your night :’)) So what did they do? They placed my calves onto their legs and let the blood flow return. And I awakened! This is now a trick I do when I feel dizzy or uncomfortable in my head. So all you do is: lay down flat next to an elevated surface (couch is usually easiest, if not a few stacked pillows) and place your legs onto that surface, making sure your hips are still on the ground. Imagine the letter ‘Z’ but if that middle line was straight. Stay there for a few minutes and let your body do its thing. 

6. Got any games on your phone?
Good for: general anxiety symptoms.
Unfortunately I was lucky enough to be stuck in an elevator once. What got me through? Candy crush. Sometimes the brain just needs an immediate distraction, and it might not always work, but it could also help. Big up the YouTube playables; they’re quick, simple, fast, and vary in demand for concentration / thought. This can often have a run-off affect to your physical symptoms, aiding as a distraction until the feeling has passed. 

7. The magic pack
Good for: all ! 
I really suggest that if you like these techniques or if you have some of your own, always take an ‘anxiety pack’ with you! It’s always a good feeling to have something you can rely on, so even if it’s just one item, I really suggest having something with you to be your lifeline in the unlikely event of sudden anxiety. 

I hope you found something interesting, or even something genuinely helpful! There are so many other techniques, I really suggest commenting to help share the community spirit and bring hope. Anxiety can be debilitating, but even if for a brief moment, there could be a way for you to have some relief and I hope I’ve helped in that journey <3

1ppf2jp,my health anxiety is awful please help,"to start, i have very bad ocd and health anxiety. last week, i started getting random pain on my lower left stomach area, nothing bad at all, but i noticed it. went on for a couple days then stopped. then my right lower side started hurting. i went to the ER and the doctor felt my stomach, pressed it, did all that and told me it was a gi virus and highly unlikely appendicitis. i didn’t get any tests btw. so that was on friday. i felt relieved then got panicked again the next day because it started to hurt again (it was pretty much hurting the whole time but nothing TOO severe) i was still able to eat, but not as much as i normally do. like twice a day. i also had a little bit of diarrhea, but no other symptoms. i went to a different ER on monday. this doctor was a bit more thorough with pressing my stomach. he basically shook my stomach, pressed my back, my foot, all that. didn’t hurt and i was fine. i told him how the pain is in my right lower side but travels upwards sometimes and goes to my back. after all that he also said it’s a gi virus. no tests still. i felt very relieved though because he thoroughly checked me. i’m panicking again because it feels heavy in my upper right stomach and the left side of my chest/breast burns. and my back hurts/feels like pressure a bit. idk if this is part of the bug, but im trying to convince myself that i wont die. i really dont wanna have to go back to the ER but i also dont wanna die lmao what do i do? is this just normal for a gi virus? if i forgot anything ill just add it to the replies.

But then also (separate from the above) get caught in anxiety loops from time to time. Completely obsessed with a thought. You could be distraught over it, thinking it’s a life altering thing. But then a week later while you would agree it is a valid thing to think over, you no longer see what the big deal was? Like it didn’t need to be that intense.

I played with AI (to organize my thoughts, not for research) and it did suggest that these random bouts (that I assumed was mild hypomania due to bipolar) could just be loops of anxiety.

I plan on asking my psychiatrist. Just curious if anyone’s experienced these loops or the random adrenaline rushes for no reason.

1ppeu1y,Extreme Anxiety About My Dog,"Looking for advice. As the title states, I (30F) have severe anxiety regarding anything having to do with my dog (3M) and his health/wellbeing. I’m not sure if this is normal (he’s my first dog that I’ve raised on my own) and if not, what I should do to make it better? Any time he makes a weird noise (gagging, burping) or I think he might have chewed something bad, I get super freaked out and paranoid that he’s going to die. If I took him to the vet every time I’ve been unsure whether I should, I would be tens of thousands of dollars in debt from emergency vet bills. I google and it usually tells me to take him, then I talk to someone I know and they reassure me he’s going to be fine. One time I was out, checked my camera and he wasn’t on the couch where he always is, I couldn’t see him, and I flew home in a panic that he was collapsed and dying. Was sobbing on the phone with my friend the whole ride home, I got here and he was sitting at the door waiting for me (the couch blocks the view). I won’t go into all the examples, but the amount of nights that I’ve sat here with my stomach in knots or unable to sleep bc I’m overanalyzing his every move & worrying something is wrong is… a large number. I used to suffer from bad anxiety when I was younger, but it’s mostly better now. Health stuff seems to be my only trigger (typically my own - and now it seems to extend to him). The idea of anything happening to my dog is terrifying and the worst thing I could imagine so I have a really hard time not freaking out over every little thing and knowing when it’s a big enough deal to go to the vet, or if it’s fine. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else deals with this and what I can do about it? How to know when I actually need to be worried about something vs over-reacting? And no I do not currently take any meds, incase anyone is going to ask that.

1ppemz0,Someone Please Tell Me I'm Not Crazy,"I will try to make this story as concise as possible. I was officially diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder at 22, when I was at my lowest ever. I'm talking about being unable to eat because I would, hours later, regurgitate it all back aggressively. I used to be unable to sleep because I felt like I'd drop dead in the middle of the night if I did so. It was really fucking bad. Thankfully, I had a genuinely caring doctor who looked at me, and told me exactly how to tackle this issue, and for the past two years and 11 months of my life, it worked excellently! But now I've been plagued with a new issue.

  
On November 28, in the middle of my job at a call center (which requires me to wear headsets and has loud noises and a very bright monitor to boot, in case this might be relevant), I began to experience a gnarly headache. Not a terrible one, but not one that could be easily-shaken either. I'd give it a four or a five on the pain scale, for example. I thought I could just ride it out, but I couldn't, so approximately at 8 P.M., I ended up taking two Tylenol pills that did the trick. No more headache! I thought I was free of this curse.

  
Then came the 29th. I woke up feeling a sensation I'd never experienced before: pressure on both of my temples. For the rest of the day, I continued working and went about my day as usual. The pressure didn't get in the way, and I thought it'd just fade away entirely on its own. Three days later, and it hasn't. It hasn't gotten worse either, but it's not improved. In fact, for two or three seconds, rarely but sporadically during the day, I feel a pulsing/throbbing pain on one side of my temples (but never both) before it recedes back into the non-painful pressure. At this point, my anxiety begins to worsen things, but I've wrestled with it, and can remain in control.

  
It's now been two whole weeks and this feeling is not going away! In fact, it seems to relocate quite often! Sometimes the pressure is in my temples, and other times it's slightly above my eyebrows. Other times it's at the top spot of the bridge of my nose, right where the tear ducts align with the nose bridge, and at other times, it's on the back of my head, right above the place in my head that's above the tip of my ears. The pressure is never in only one side either, but always in both sides of the face. I finally saw a doctor, who just chuckled and said ""I don't think it's anything bad, probably just a stress headache,"" even though I told her I've been like this for 15 days counting that day. She prescribed me to take Neurobion shots.

  
Now I don't know if it was just placebo, but it seemed to have helped! The pressure had lessened and I felt like I was at the end of the tunnel! But alas, it has not fully gone away... I went to my psychiatrist again, who told me that I shouldn't mistake anxiety for actual symptoms, and medics shouldn't treat anxiety as the root cause of it all either. He was actually pretty up-to-speed with that stigma in the healthcare community of my country (which is not Canada or the U.S.A., I live in a country in Central America). He prescribed me an anxiolytic called Melex, and a painkiller called Dalivium. 

  
I've taken my second shot of Neurobion, and one of the six Dalivium painkiller liquids today, but the feeling of pressure persists, and the hypochondriac in me is making things worse... ""What if it's a brain tumor? Or worse, Brain Cancer? What if it's intracranial pressure?"" It's now been 18 days counting today, and I feel like I'm going mad...

  
Another symptom that I experience is that, at random points during the day, I sometimes feel like, for a second, I lose my balance and the world spins a bit too fast before my brain refocuses and properly processes the world around me, and this also occurs even when I'm just sitting and move my head a bit too fast. Another oddity is that whenever I find myself just going about my day, either walking/running on the treadmill, doing chores, or otherwise performing some kind of activity, my body 'forgets' about the pressure, and I'm able to feel 'normal' again, but the moment I lay down in a bed or sit down, the pressure returns. Right now, I can barely feel it, but I still do, on my temples currently.

  
I seriously don't know what to do now... Does anyone have any answers, or has experienced anything like this? Please tell me I'm not losing my mind...

1ppek3r,Anyone else obsess over their memory?,"I’ve noticed that ever since I’ve gotten used to a sorta monotonous lifestyle I’ve started to flat out look for things to freak out about and I was curious if anyone else kinda related to it. 
1. Anxious over insignificant small things, for example if I turn on the tv like 5 mins later I’ll try to remember the action of me turning on the tv despite the fact that I’m currently watching and enjoying the tv. And I often know I turned the tv on cause I’ve been sitting there watching for god knows how long but my brain wants the specific memory of me turning the tv on which is hard to find because that specific action has become an automatic thing I don’t even process anymore, it’s sorta like putting in my passcode for my phone I don’t need to focus on remembering each time I put it in because I know it. 
2. The second issue is my spacing out over long periods of time, for example sometimes I’ll watch a video than think about that video while walking around my house on autopilot,  for like 3 mins straight, go on my phone, use the restroom, scroll through YouTube mindlessly without clicking on a video, than I have the audacity to be like “wait that much time has passed what was I even doing?” And I usually remember the bathroom part and some of the posts but my brain was on autopilot for like 99% of it that I don’t even process it anymore. 
Stuff like this than leads to me just freaking out and going straight for “ah must be very early onset Alzheimer’s ”, despite the fact that I literally know that it’s just me spacing out.

1pp9cug,"Home for Xmas, sleeping problems","Hi everyone :) I am home for Christmas this year, I love home usually but the past year my mum unfortunately started waking up screaming / shouting in the night, this happened a couple of times when I am home and I found it extremelyyyy upsetting. I have very bad anxiety, and I also am extremely sensitive to sudden loud noises, screaming / shouting etc. I have been ever since I was a kid, and i’m not sure why? But I am so stressed out about sleeping, I’m here until early January and I literally can’t think of any solution to try and rest.

My mum never remembers what she’s dreamt about, if she even has. And once she’s awake she’s fine, she doesn’t get anxious about going to sleep. She’s spoken to a few people and a lot say it could be trauma resurfacing or something along the lines of that.

I have spoken to my mum a few times about this issue, she understands but also can’t really do anything about it. I don’t hold any anger towards her because of this, I understand she’s not doing it on purpose.

It’s moreso the apprehension that keeps me awake, if that makes sense. My brain is stuck in fight or flight mode because it’s waiting for something to happen. It’s also obviously very upsetting hearing a loved one in that much distress - the first time it happened I literally thought somebody was in our house and my brain went into a real sense of danger!! It was genuinely horrible. I actually feel like I have a bit of trauma from it, nobody should ever have to be put in that state. I can’t even imagine when it’s actually real.

Ive tried headphones for sleeping but I find them really uncomfortable. I’ve taken melatonin to try help me sleep, but I then usually wake up in the middle of the night again for some reason and I’m back being anxious. I’ve got propranolol and diazepam however it’s usually the same case with melatonin, I wake up in the middle of the night and I can’t sleep.

There is also a lot going on in my house right now. My parents are on the brink of being seperated / divorced so there is a lot of tension and I have a lot of mixed emotions. I also usually tend to get more anxiety spikes at home just because my old bedroom I tend to associate with being more anxious.

So I am also trying to be respectful with my mum as I know she already has so much going on and I don’t want her to feel guilty. But Im literally feeling constantly panicked because I’m worried about trying to get to sleep tonight.

So yeah - if anybody has any advice for me I would really really appreciate it. I know it’s kind of hard to understand why this all causes me so much upset, but I can’t even explain it myself, it’s just how I am wired. Screaming / loud noises are literally one of my worst triggers so I’m feeling extremely stressed out and emotional",2,0,2025-12-18 03:26:30,Puzzleheaded_End4099,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pp9cug/home_for_xmas_sleeping_problems/,anxiety,1.0,Advice Needed,-0.9977,-0.023303571428571423,-0.40120136737823486,-1,-0.5045713979748317,-1

But the first times they felt like heartburn on the heart. After I had a hydrocution (because of a very bad digestion) that nearly killed me I no longer feel heartburn, I feel my stomac burning, twiching and palpitating. My heart raises then It goes slower, then I feel pain on my stomac, then my heart raises again and the cycle repeats Itself until I'm exhausted. It doesn't go away until I pee and poop (It can last hours). Usually It happens in the middle of the night (which is also when the hydrocution happened). The only logicsl explication I came up with is that now every time I have some gut issues It triggers a panick attack. So I think that's why It might last hours, because it's constantly triggered.

1ppe0y8,Afraid about my heart lying in bed at 3am,"So for the past three or four days I had a strange form of stress, which basically lasts the whole day (but it magically stops when I talk to someone or focus on some activity) and generally feels like a rush of adrenaline, chest tightness and pain.

  
And here I am, lying in bed at night, scared to death. It's not that I feel chest pains, it's... a sort of chest numbness and tightness I guess? And I constantly check pulse, afraid.

  
I did ecg and ultrasound two months ago, doctor said everything is ok. I don't exercise, but three weeks ago started to walk 3-5km every day. I used to do kick boxing for a whole year, but quitted two months ago. 

  
But despite how much I tell myself that it is very very unlikely that I have some sort of heart thing, some part of my brain simply comes up with a new thing. For example: ""yes, I did ecg and ultrasound, but it was two months ago - am I sure my heart is fine after these months?"" Or another one: ""there is a 'broken heart syndrome' which can cause a heart attack and is triggered by stress; since I am stressing, could it be possible that I have that syndrome?"" 

And these thoughts just destroy any hope for convincing myself that it's not my heart. The only thing that helps me is sleep. 

  
Does anyone else have it? If so, can you share some advice on how to 'covince' yourself that it's not a heart issue (apart from doing ecg and etc.)?",1,2,2025-12-18 06:49:59,ObjectiveFood4795,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ppe0y8/afraid_about_my_heart_lying_in_bed_at_3am/,anxiety,1.0,Health,-0.8999,0.05265151515151515,-0.633787989616394,1,-0.576333691777894,-1

Death, health, catastrophe, loss, everything. My mind never leaves those subjects.

I spend every night not being able to sleep like ""what if I die in the night? No one's awake to save me, they wouldn't be aware. Not even I'm awake to save me"".

The therapy waiting lists are so embarrassingly long here I can't even get proper treatment. I need antidepressants again. I quot and it all came back.

1pp7y16,Could hyperstimulation stress/anxiety for 2 months cause peripheral neuropathy ?,"\[Male, 48, 400lbs, diabetic\]

So I was locked in to fight or flight for 2 whole months, legs (only legs) would tingle like crazy all day and night, I would often rapidly breathe and have to calm myself, I would panic if a phone rang while I was asleep, very easily scared, etc.

My concern was getting diabetic neuropathy, my brother in law got it 6 months ago and was adamant it was caused by diabetes even though he was only just pre-diabetic. But when he would phone me and talk about his fears it would send me in to an anxious mode. The hyperstimulation would last about 2 weeks and then my brother in law would often phone me every 2 to 3 weeks, so when the tingling in my legs stopped it would begin again as soon as he talked about it, so I rarely got time off from it. I could go from zero tingling in my legs to immediate tingling when his neuropathy was talked about.

In my brain I had ""it attacks the extremities"" and ""toes fall off"" and other things he was terrified about happening to him, these comments were going through my mind daily, always, I obsessed over all the fears he had but on myself. My diabetic levels are much higher than his so I was extra scared I could get it soon.

Then all of a sudden a month ago I got diabetic neuropathy, after 2 months of this hyperstimulation. I can't feel my toes, no sensation in feet, and incredible burning and prickling feelings in my feet, all day every day.

My fear is the anxiety causing muscle tension and constricted blood vessels for so long may have stopped my toes and feet getting all the nutrients and blood needed. So killing off the nerves. This happened very suddenly, I got 2 days of stabbing toes and then woke up with dead feet and toes stiff as a rake, the toe stiffness eased up but I can't feel them when touched.

Also I have no idea if I had underlying diabetic neuropathy that was asymptomatic, so maybe this tipped it over the edge in to symptomatic.

What is the likelihood of this happening or more likely coincidence ?",2,0,2025-12-18 02:30:11,vscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pp7y16/could_hyperstimulation_stressanxiety_for_2_months/,anxiety,1.0,Discussion,-0.9961,0.023918650793650808,-0.6106376647949219,-1,-0.5993651022387307,-1

today at work at around 16:15 I went to the bathroom (we use the bathroom in the shopping centre I work that has been closed off to the public) and walked into the stall to find a very small amount of vomit in the toilet.

im home and am now in shambles and am extremely concerned I've been exposed to norovirus via particles in the air. I washed my hands thoroughly after I finished in the bathroom but I do have dermatophagia which I have been making a conscious effort to not give in to since this afternoon.

What would happen to my mother if one of her parents died?
What will I do then?
How long after the first grandparent's death, do I have to wait for the next one to pass away?
How will I cope with their deaths?

I've had experiences with the deaths of friends and family, and I generally HATE anything related to death or terminal illnesses. I don't feel like listening to the news or attending funerals, which are usually attended by people who know someone. I really CAN'T stand death.

I was speaking with a friend I’ve known for about 10 years now on Monday. While we were talking the realisation that this is the first face to face conversation that I’ve had with someone in weeks. He asked how long I’ve been doing this and I realised after the covid lockdowns, I never really left that isolation. 

For context, for the past five years I’ve practically confined myself to one spot depending on where I am. I barely leave the house, even if work requires me to go to the office I have been to the office a collective five times this year. Out of a required two-three times a week. When I caught up with my friend, I had my blinds and windows open to let light and fresh air in, yet when I’m alone I shut my entire house, my only real light sources being my work laptop and personal computer.

Now I know that’s not a healthy lifestyle and I do not recommend it. For context, I’m 27, and I’ve dealt with anxiety and other things for close to 15 years at this point. All that to say.

I went out on the request of my friend tonight to a party, and I’ve never felt so uncomfortable as I did at that Christmas party. I wasn’t in my space, I couldn’t play the new game I bought (COE33) and I was around people I know who care about me but I just couldn’t stop myself from isolating in a corner away from everyone. It’s a first step, and it was uncomfortable as fuck, but while a part of me wishes I’d stayed home, another part of me is glad I could see everyone again.

Sorry if this breaks any rules or anything wasn’t my intention at all so if mods remove it that’s fine.

Have a good night/day everyone.",6,2,2025-12-17 18:02:55,Gussy_hunts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pove65/i_had_a_realisation_on_monday/,anxiety,1.0,Trigger Warning,0.7233,0.045121212121212124,0.0,0,0.22601424242424245,1

1potfwn,How to get treatment without insurance?,"I make too much for Medicaid and I can’t afford any of the ACA plans anymore. Even if I could afford the premiums, none of them cover outpatient mental health appointments until after you hit the deductible. So I would have to pay $200/session with my therapist on top of the premium. Plus medication management sessions and the drugs themselves. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m finally getting a handle on my mental health and my life and it’s all about to go away

Even if I find somewhere else to get therapy it just sucks. I finally found a therapist I like and now I’m going to have to start all over with someone else.

I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, with occasional panic attacks, but it was always manageable. I’m now 4 months postpartum with my second child and was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto’s.

About 8 weeks ago, my anxiety became overwhelming. I had been on 50 mg of Zoloft for a few years and was doing okay. Five weeks ago, my dose was increased to 75 mg, and since then it’s been really hard. I experienced daily panic attacks for about 10 days straight and constant, intense anxiety.

Now my doctor wants to increase it to 100 mg. I’m honestly dreading it because of how bad the first increase felt. But I’m still dealing with anxiety and panic now, so part of me feels like I might as well try, since I already feel anxious anyway.

1pp2op8,The problem is I think this is actually what I think it is,"Doctor denying MRI scan. Worsening symptoms, declining.

31 female. severe head pain with physical movement?

I want to start off by saying, I applaud everyone in this community and admire the strength I read through the forums. You are all amazing. 

hi everyone - i’ve been struggling with this for MONTHS now and i genuinely cannot get this to stop. whenever i cough, stand, stretch, lift myself up from the bed or the floor, or even just turn my head to the side, i get an incredibly painful headache all around my head for anywhere from 10 seconds to a couple minutes, and then it goes away. It’s very aligned with my heartbeat, but it hurts. i’ve fixed my sleeping schedule, i have tried exercising more, i’ve tried taking vitamins (vitamin D, iron tablets, etc), and i’ve tried using technology less and eating better, but nothing is helping. there isn’t any other symptoms, but a extreme nausea at times. I keep zofran going as it’s the only thing that helps. 

This all started this past October. I went to my local ER 3 times and they finally did a head CT without contrast. Which they said was clear. I had a brain MRI in 2022 (also clear) so my new doctor is refusing to order another one because of that and a “clear CT” since it’s not enough reason to order another. I’m declining severely. I don’t know the odds of it being a tumor or something sinister. To my understanding and with my research, I’m not entirely sure I can depend on the CT results. Any advice and information is greatly appreciated.

I want to say that I've recently been to my GP and all bloodwork is normal.  I had a CT scan not long ago.  I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety quite a few years ago and Panic Attacks. 

Also - I use to take SSRIs (Lexapro, Zoloft). Now I just take anti-anxiety meds when I need them. 

I'm 41 and 210 lbs. I work out and run on a normal basis. Eat a decent diet. 

Now the symptoms:

Neuropathy (pins and needles, sometimes burning feeling, sometimes numbness) This comes and goes but recently has been very bad (again...)

Dizziness/feeling off balance/vertigo at times

I do have TMJ which I'm going to therapy for at the moment as well as Upper Cervical Chiropractic Care.

My eyes feel heavy, fatigue, and sometimes ear fullness.

Recently my anxiety has been out of control.

I've been to every Dr under the sun throughout the years and trying to find a solution.

The worst part recently is just the pins and needles and pain.  It's driving my crazy!

1pox7cu,Work and self-purpose anxiety,"Hi, this will be a longer as I need to write this out. I'm 33 and I haven't got any strong tendency to any career in my life. I have never really examined what I like when I was younger as I was raised in small city in central Europe where wasnt much to do. So I chose college pragmatically, I was good in math and logical thinking so I went to economics college. There I found out I dont like finance, accounting or anything similar. I moved to city close to my family where IT sector was booming so I started as application administrator. I was quite good at it but it wasnt still ""my calling"". Then I wanted to earn more so I changed teams and technology, that wasnt good decision as team wasnt good and new technology too hard to learn. I quit and tried to sell designs online, I decided I wanted to learn graphic design as I was interested about Etsy, Redbubble on youtube. I found out it is not as easy to be successful as youtube videos trying to show you. After half year I went back to IT as I needed money, again wrong team, terrible application with lot of escalations. I quit again and officialy my work anxiety began as I look retrospectively.  I tried to sell on Etsy one more time putting all my energy into it and to learning graphic design for 4 months. Again not successful enough. I tried to find job in graphic design or marketing. As there were only few job opportunities for self taught graphic designer with little experience I found job in marketing where was stressful environment with worcoholic boss and toxic team. My work anxiety fully developed as I was vomiting in the morning before work and went to psychiatrist. Now I am taking meds and tried to work in retail as shop assistant but I hated it so now I am jobless. And I write a book - fantasy scifi new adult genre which I like to do but still I dont earn money doing it. No idea what to do next. I am thinking about going to  psychic lol.

1pp5pd3,Thoughts Post-ER visit,"A few days back, I went to the ER for tachycardia and an abnormal pulse. It was anxiety or stress because of my college assignments. I've been doing near nothing in terms of work because I don't want my heart to strain too much again. 

I tried opening my Google docs today, and the heart ache I got was actually horrifying. I had to close it instantly. I really like my degree, in fact, I want to do more. I'm a second year social justice/politics student, and I want to become a professor or official researcher one day. I currently just can't fathom how I'm going to get there if I can't even open and finish a second year essay. 

I've always been stressed, with anxiety. It's even caused my IBS for some time now since August of 2024. Even as a kid, I'd get a panic attack here and there when it'd come to academics, and it would always pass within a day or two. The ER visit and IBS have really shined a light where I simply just can't ignore or pass up what anxiety I'm going through anymore. 

The advise that I read online is always the same. Meditation, deep breaths, go on a walk. If it's not about mindfulness, it just says yeah go on X or Y drug. Since of February this year, I've been on amitriptyline 25mg so I don't particularly want to go on any new medication if that's the solution. I need to get back to the place where I was. A normal student, semi stressed, who could actually finish their assignments on time without emailing their professors that every time I open their tab, I spiral. 

It's been 2 days since my ER visit, and 3 days since my symptoms of heart ache/palpitations have continued. They've gotten better now that I have done near to no work, but I don't know how to get back into work. How do I return back to the 'norm' or normality? Any advise would really be helpful. How do we cope with such immense anxiety and stress? What can I do to relieve myself of such a burden?

1pp54up,I don't know how to get out of this,"Hi everyone, I would like to share some stuff over here about what I am going through, every bit of advice or anything would help and I do read it. I've initially posted this over at /breakups but I think people with Anxiety might be more understanding and can help me more then over there.

I've been with my ex for nearly 5 years. We got together when we were both young (I was 20, she was 18) 6 months into the relationship she pretty much lived at my place and it stayed like that.

I suffer from severe anxienty, and when I say severe, it really is. It's an issue I've been struggeling with all my life and over the years it would only get worse and worse. I've had many therapist which never helped, even during the relationship I tried therapy for my anxienty. I pretty much struggle with leaving the house. Some days I wouldn't even be able to do grocery shopping around the corner.

She always wanted to experience fun activities with me; holidays in different countries, visiting different cities, roadtrips, restaurants you know the basic stuff... I could never do these things with her, my anxienty would take over... I really wanted to do it, cause I wanted to experience these things with her aswell but I never succeeded. I couldn't hold a job, I'd have a bad sleep schedule aswell you know I was just a mess....

Yes we've gone to the cinema, restaurants, walk some Parks etc but all in the neighorhood becuase my anxienty wouldn't allow me to get further then that YET. It sounds like our relationship was terrible if you hear all of this ofcourse, but we had a lot of good moments, a lot of love and fun together aswell. (I just want to explicitly mention it so people don't think it was some awful relationship, there is a reason she stayed for 5 years)

6 months ago she decided it was over, my anxienty took a toll over her mental health over the years. I don't blame her and at the same time I also do blame her for leaving me.

I really worked so hard on myself when she left me, I pretty much went beyond my own limits regarding my anxienty to try and overcome my anxienty to show her that I could in fact provide the life she wanted and deserved.

Unfortunately I was too late. She gave me nearly 5 years to overcome my anxienty and it was too late to fix things now.

My point is everyone;

I think about her everyday. I've cried and cried so much these 6 months becuase I miss her. I've allowed myself to grief, feel every emotion for months. I'm currently at the stage where I even try to distract my mind instantly when I think about her. I've tried everything and yet I still feel miserable, depressed and anxious.

I am scared that this feeling will never go away and that I am stuck in like an unending loop of feeling this way.

I don't have many people around me (grew up in fostercare) I dont go outside much. I am very much a lone wolf, which was fine becuase I had her she was my whole world, and pretty much the only person in the world who made me feel loved and welcome.

I even tried some datingapps to distract myself and communicate with some woman to see if it helps get my mind off of her but unfortunatly I couldn't get myself a single like/conversation besides the occasional oger which obviously doesn't help with my confidence.

I am trying to accept the fact that she is gone, that she won't come back otherwise she would've been back already but I've been trying to accept this for months already and I can't seem to let go somehow, I think it's becuase I am afraid. Afraid that I will lose the plot if I let her go out of my heart (the one person who actually gave me much joy over the years)

I forced myself to not watch any of her socials but if I am honest, I've failed multiple times and all I see is how happy she is, enjoying life, doing fun activities and I realise everyday that she wakes up everyday with the fact of beleving that me not being part of her life anymore is for the best and that kills me inside.

I am afraid I will end up alone and never get out of this emotional depressive state.

1por7h8,My anxiety is unbearable now,"I'll start this off by saying my anxiety nowadays is so bad to the point it's unbearable and it drives me insane to the point of self medicating just to feel ""normal"" 

About 6 months ago I was in a weird spot in my addiction I had just got out of rehab and went balls to the wall I got some cocaine , Valium , alcohol , n tramadol/Xanax capsules and the night went drank 20 something shots n popped 2 tramadol xan caps and a valium or 2 and did some coke 

(this was my 2nd time doing coke)

(The tramadol Xan capsules were supposedly crushed up Xanax and tramadol in a capsule)

As you can assume I blacked out that night and I fought my step dad apparently and long story short got the cops called and got locked up 
and I got searched and had the pills on me , and the tramadol/xan caps I had came back from the lab and one of them had fentanyl and some had tramadol but no Xanax smh

And let me also put I went through 80 valium 5mg pills in a 2 week span a little before this incident 

Since that day I've stopped doing shit I only do shrooms alcohol and smoke weed now but my anxiety is actually unbearable I have panic attacks daily it's the worst while sleeping I wake up tryna breathe for air n shit n my heart drops to my stomach 

My anxiety has always been bad and a challenge in life but nowadays it's so bad I just want to sit in my room and isolate 

I don't feel comfortable in my own skin any human interaction makes me anxious and it kills my self confidence and I feel like a ""pussy"" I look down on my self for it even tho it's something out of my control

 When I get into verbal arguments with people there's this constant lump in my throat and if I'm panicked my voice will shake like a leaf , I used to be able to be very calm in situations engaging aggressive people now i feel like a little pussy

Im on a medication called buspar for anxiety and it doesn't help at all and I've tried a few other medications, no luck either

Nowadays I can't even drink energy drinks caffeine sends me into panic mode I get cold and jittery of 80mg of caffeine low doses and just feel like shit and it makes my already bad heart palpitations worse 

(I also want to add before this I used to abuse dxm for about 2 years and have done hella fake acid)

I don't get it tho my anxiety shouldnt be this bad I know people who have done hella hard drugs and are fine they have anxiety but not like I do

For instance I can walk into the living room and my heart can sink to my stomach for no reason , or I can see a message at the top of my screen otp same shit

Not great. 

She won’t up my dosage, which I get. If I’m being honest, I worry that I’m getting brain fog and other side effects from long term use. But now she wants me to try gabapentin in addition to the Xanax. She said it will help me wean on/make me feel the effects of the Xanax more. Thoughts?

1poolrm,I'm exhausted by myself,"Anxious rambling ahead...

I (20/f) have had anxiety all my life (since I was 6) and through my life I get periods where I'm worse and I'm so exhausted by it, mentally and physically. 

I get time's where I'm anxious about everything: going out, something going wrong... everything going wrong. And I just can't stop myself, I'll just be constantly worrying and restless.

Then there's times I get focused on a specific topic such as my health, fire and dying in my sleep.

And right now I'm in my fire period again. This means I'm constantly worried the house will set on fire, that I won't be able to prevent it, that I'll get stuck, that I'll lose all my documents, that I can't get my dog out (he's a cane corso and sleeps in a cage or he will eat things).

When I cook I have to stand  there the whole time watching if it'll start smoking or if something will go wrong. I have to unplug everything if I'm not currently using it or I think it'll burst into flames. 
I'm paranoid if anything smells slightly off, cause I think something is going to happen 

I just don't know what to do anymore. My life is a mess, I barely sleep (it's literally 5.30am) the only time I went out was to the gym but they've shut till April for refurbishment. I'm trying to find a job, but between my anxiety and other health problems I'm not able to do most things, because I stupidly set my heart on wanting to study at a expensive university - Norland.

I do live with my mum but we don't really talk about mental health. I also don't have any friends, we all just lost touch through time.

1pp2fjk,"Started Zoloft for anxiety, ended up feeling detached from reality - has this happened to anyone else?","Hi everyone. This is my first time posting on Reddit and honestly I feel scared to put this out there, but I really need to share my experience and see if anyone can relate because I am struggling and I need to know if this will subside.

I want to talk about my experience taking Zoloft for anxiety for about one week and then stopping.

For some background: I’ve had anxiety my entire life. I struggle mainly with intrusive thoughts, especially at night, which used to keep me from sleeping. What helped me most was praying before bed — it often quieted my thoughts enough for me to finally fall asleep. I’ve tried managing my anxiety on my own with breathing exercises, working out, cutting out caffeine, and staying busy. I also tried ashwagandha for about a month, but it caused dissociation, something I had never experienced before. It scared me enough that I stopped taking it and told myself I could handle this on my own.

I never formally saw a therapist, but I would occasionally mention my anxiety to my primary care doctor. Therapy and medication were always discussed as options. On November 14th, I went to my doctor for a cold and was prescribed amoxicillin. During that visit, I brought up my anxiety again. I ended up bursting into tears, as did my mother who was with me, and my doctor suggested starting Zoloft 50 mg and possibly therapy. This time, I agreed. I decided to start the Zoloft after finishing my antibiotics.

I took my first dose of Zoloft on November 24th, and that’s when everything changed.

Day 1 was fine. On Day 2, while I was at work, I suddenly felt a tingling sensation throughout my body along with intense anxiety and a sense of detachment from myself. I felt like I wasn’t fully “there.” I tried to push through it by walking around, staying busy, massaging my arms, and talking to coworkers just to feel normal again. The detachment didn’t fully go away.

Over the next several days, I noticed extreme fluctuations — some days I felt completely exhausted, other days overwhelmingly anxious. The worst day was Sunday. I had already had a stressful shift at work, and then I felt this cold wave of anxiety wash over my body. While someone was talking to me, I experienced what I can only describe as depersonalization. I felt disconnected from my body and from reality itself. My hands felt numb and tingly, like they weren’t mine. I kept squeezing them just to feel something real.

Nothing seemed to help after that. People didn’t feel real when they talked to me. I started having thoughts about wanting everything to stop, not because I wanted to hurt myself, but because the sensation was unbearable. I ended up crying alone in the bathroom from the anxiety and fear.

At night, my sleep became terrible. I would have muscle twitches and feel jolted awake right as I was drifting off. I never experienced panic or dissociation like this before starting Zoloft.

I reached out to my doctor and stopped taking Zoloft on December 2nd. They told me I didn’t need to taper since I had only been on it for 9 days.

Since stopping, I honestly feel unlike myself. I’m experiencing intense anxiety, ongoing detachment from my body, and emotional distress. Even typing this right now, I’m in tears because I don’t understand what’s happening to me. I wish I had never started Zoloft if I had known it would make me feel worse than I did at baseline.

The hardest part is the constant feeling of unreality and hopelessness — like this will never end. I’m constantly on edge. Sleeping is still difficult, and the twitching hasn’t fully gone away.

I’ve read about Zoloft triggering mania in some people, sometimes revealing underlying bipolar disorder. I do have a family history of mental health issues, though much of my Caribbean family doesn’t believe in mental health and it was often brushed off. As much of my family has aged they have now been diagnosed with depression, mild bipolar disorder, OCD, and ADHD. Now I’m terrified that Zoloft triggered something in my brain or that I’m developing another condition.

I keep spiraling into fears about schizophrenia or other dissociative disorders. Maybe I’m overthinking, but what I’m experiencing feels very real, and I just want it to stop. I want to feel like myself again. It has been hard to explain to others how I feel but much of my actions throughout the day feel robotic.

Has anyone else experienced this after starting or stopping Zoloft? Did it get better? Any thoughts or shared experiences would really mean a lot.",1,3,2025-12-17 22:55:54,AccurateRestaurant65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pp2fjk/started_zoloft_for_anxiety_ended_up_feeling/,anxiety,0.6,Medication,-0.9972,0.018127551020408174,-0.531184196472168,-1,-0.5611265880320023,-1
1popppx,Ongoing physical symptoms + anxiety spiral — struggling to feel normal again,"Hi everyone,

I’m posting here because I’ve been having a really hard time and I don’t know how to break out of this cycle.

About 7 weeks ago I started feeling unwell. At first I thought it was just the flu, but it never really stopped. I felt constantly tired and off, without being able to clearly explain what was wrong. Because of this, I ended up doing a lot of tests: multiple blood tests, X-rays, an ultrasound, and even going to the ER. Everything came back completely normal, except for ferritin, which was elevated (around 370, with the upper limit being ~250).

I’ve spoken with two doctors, and both told me that there’s nothing to do right now and that all the tests look fine overall. Physically, things have started to improve a bit, but this long period of feeling unwell really triggered my anxiety. 

Everyone just say that I’m recovery from a virus or something similar and it might take a lot of months. 

Now I’m stuck in a constant loop of checking my body for symptoms and thinking that something terrible is wrong or that I’m about to die, even though the doctors say I’m okay. Some days I feel bad physically, other days it feels like the anxiety itself is what’s making me feel bad — and most days it’s probably both. Either way, I don’t feel like I can have a normal day anymore.

I had been doing much better with anxiety before all of this, and it’s really discouraging to feel like I’m back at the beginning again. I guess I’m just looking to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar — especially health anxiety after a long, unexplained physical issue — and how you managed to cope or slowly feel normal again.",7,10,2025-12-17 12:10:48,noysma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1popppx/ongoing_physical_symptoms_anxiety_spiral/,anxiety,1.0,Health,-0.9691,-0.023359073359073355,-0.6828941106796265,1,-0.6368488700116279,-1
1pp24a0,How can I avoid thinking about the future death of my parents and grandparents?,"Hello, I'd like to know how I can cope with thoughts about the impending deaths of my grandparents and parents.

To begin, I should mention that I have two maternal grandparents: my grandfather, who is 83, and my grandmother, who is 75. They are both in good health and can do activities without problems. The problem started when one of my grandfather's brothers died in 2022 from diabetes-related complications, and since then I've been thinking a lot about: What would happen to my mother if one of her parents died? What will I do then? How long after the first grandparent's death do I have to wait for the next one to die? How will I cope with their deaths?

I don't want to think about it anymore; I just want peace of mind for now, and whatever happens, happens. I understand this perfectly, but I need more advice or experiences on how others have dealt with this (if anyone has gone through the same thing). I feel exhausted thinking about this at 23.


I've had experiences with the death of friends and family, and I generally HATE anything related to death or terminal illness. I don't want to hear the news or attend funerals, which are usually attended by people who knew someone. I really CAN'T stand death.

1pq5vip,I have become a creep,"M57. Married. 

I have become utterly obsessed with a much younger woman. 

To the point where I have taken (minor) risks of getting caught having midnight texting sessions. 

I’ve been honest with her and make no bones about what I am doing as obsessive behaviour. 

She humours me. And honestly we do get on. We’ve known each a while before this obsession exploded. 

In almost 20 years of marriage I have never cheated (I count this obsession as cheating). But I think I would genuinely ruin my life to get anything from this woman.

1pqcm9j,Previous boyfriend of five years is dating someone else and I’m trying not to be self destructive,"Long story short: 5 year long relationship ended two months ago. Healthiest relationship I have ever had, we had plans of getting married and were crafting the rings. He broke up with me due to “realizing that he doesn’t want to commit in the ways I need him to” I.e. clean the living space, contribute to planning dates, etc. I KNOW that’s a bad long term partner, and that’s not what I’m wanting to talk about. 

TODAY, two months after the break up, I found out he’s dating someone. This sent me into a furious rage because he affirmed that as we were breaking up that I’m his “ideal partner” and that he wishes he had more desire to contribute to the relationship. Saying he just couldn’t handle the stress and anxiety of it all (I know). So I figured if he wanted to date someone this close to our breakup and I’m his “ideal partner” wouldn’t he want to get back together with me…? We also discussed how we weren’t going to see anyone. Not on the premise of getting back together, but that we both recognized we really need to work on ourselves. 

I’m stuck between so many feelings and I need help on knowing how to cope:

The 3 dominant feelings: 

1. Relief - THANK GOD I’m not married to him 

2. Anger/sadness - He played in my face/said things that don’t align with his actions/why did I spend so much time trying to get him to love me

3. Wanting to be chosen. This one is the scariest for me. I keep having a fantasy where he’s choosing me over the other girl and I feel flooded with euphoria. I do not WANT this to happen and I know it’s a bad idea. I also cut off all communication with him after finding out this information. 

Do I just sit and be uncomfortable? It’s taking an incredible amount of will power not to text him to get some sort of physical relief through a hug or even a kiss. Something that would make me feel temporarily soothed and then likely very shitty later. Any advice, kindness, and/or solidarity would be appreciated.

1pqfm6t,How long should someone be in therapy?,"I (30F) have been with my therapist for 7 years now, with a session every week (aside from the 2-ish years I was in and out of eating disorder treatment). I have anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder, and I used to have SI frequently. For the past three years, SI hasn’t really been as much of an issue, and I’ve felt much happier. I still hold a lot of anxiety in my body and struggle to cope with the physical effects sometimes, and I have a lot of anxiety around travel/vacations. My depression is much better than it used to be as well, but I still feel numb sometimes and struggle to get out of bed every day. I feel fatigue every day.

My family knows I see a therapist, and they were the ones who encouraged me to. But now, when I mention therapy, they have lots of thoughts about how long I’ve been in therapy. My mom (60F) has literally asked me “when therapy ends” and has recently made comments indicating that I should decrease how many sessions I have. I’m usually fine when I skip a session, but I have some stressful things coming up at the tail end of the year/beginning of the new year, so I don’t want to miss the opportunity to have one or two more sessions this year. I’m pretty stable in many areas of my mental health, but on the occasion that I do have a panic attack, it’s usually not a small one. And I don’t want to go back to near-constant SI because I’m not in enough therapy.

How long is it okay to see a therapist? Is it okay to be in therapy for this long?",3,2,2025-12-19 13:32:34,anonhumanontheweb,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pqfm6t/how_long_should_someone_be_in_therapy/,therapy,1.0,Question,-0.8487,0.14700126262626265,0.0,1,-0.22520974747474748,-1

Before, I asked if he'd accept a gift from me, he asked what it was and I told him. He only said he's not allowed to take money or gift cards and thanked me. 

I don't even know if he opened it or not, I left because I was under a time crunch and honestly felt a little embarrassed (the session that day was pretty rough). 

I was prepared for him not accepting the gift, which I honestly would have understood but I was not prepared to get no feedback whatsoever and it kind of hurts. 
We had a brief call yesterday and he didn't mention it. 

My next appointment is in three weeks and I am struggling if I should tell my therapist about feeling insecure and kind of rejected about this topic or not. I'm afraid I made him uncomfortable, which was not my intention at all, but I probably didn't read the room correctly.

In general, I often get anxious that he'll terminate our sessions since I'm not making progress quickly.

1pq8hd7,My therapist said they can’t help me because I keep bringing up the same thing,"I told her this situation and she gave me worksheets to go through with my bf but then told me she can’t help me: 

TW

We were together for five years. There were good times, I guess, but there were also so many times I was genuinely scared of him. Times when I felt completely powerless and alone. Things would be fine and then something horrible would happen, and afterwards he’d act like nothing ever happened. I started questioning if I was remembering things right, if I was losing my mind.

I’ve been avoiding saying this, but I think the relationship was abusive. And now I’m in this awful place where I feel torn apart inside. I don’t want to destroy his life - he has nothing. No money, nowhere stable to live, serious mental health problems. But what he did to me was horrible. I can’t just pretend it didn’t happen.

His family either ignores what he does or makes excuses for him. When I try to talk about it, they make me feel like I’m crazy - not just him, but them too. It makes me doubt everything.

Here’s what I know happened:

One time I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.

He pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.

He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I said no, he kept shoving it at me until it spilled everywhere, then he slapped me and called me a stupid bitch. Said I was the problem.

He got drunk and stormed into my apartment screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my stuff around, ripped my shirt off me, and held me down. My roommate had to physically kick him out.

The first time he grabbed my throat, I was half-naked. I had to do a Zoom meeting after with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up later, he said it was sexual and that I was exaggerating.

He wouldn’t drive me to work unless we had sex first. If I cried or was running late, he’d threaten to just leave me there.

During sex, when he got frustrated or couldn’t get hard, he’d pinch me hard, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a bitch.

Once he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.

He drove like a maniac, pulling my hair and saying we were both going to die because I talked about leaving him. I had a complete panic attack.

He choked me. Multiple times. Not for long, but long enough to scare the hell out of me.

He wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.

His cousin heard me crying during a fight and came in to check. He got even more pissed and blamed me for letting someone see me like that.

When his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt so humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.

He used to “check” me to see if I’d been with other guys, while he was out there cheating on me.

He bit my face when he was angry and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.

I think early in our relationship he did something sexual to me when I was half-asleep after getting high. It’s fuzzy but it still haunts me.

If I said something hurt or that I wanted to stop during sex, he’d laugh at me, say I was lying, or just keep going.

He called me a cheater for wanting to hang out with friends or family. Meanwhile he was the one lying and cheating.

I hate admitting this, but sometimes I just gave in to sex because I was scared of what would happen if I said no. I’d cry during it or after and feel like my body wasn’t mine anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or made me stay in positions until he was done with whatever he was doing.

One time the neighbors heard me crying and him screaming. He was throwing things, yelling threats through the wall, saying he’d kill them. Later he blamed me for the whole thing.

So why do I still feel so confused about everything?

He’s been through trauma. He has mental health issues. Part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that makes what he did okay.

Is this actually abuse? Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he wouldn’t let me stop?

I feel like I’m losing my mind trying to understand it all. And I still feel guilty. I can’t make myself report anything - he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left him. But I’m still carrying around all this pain and I don’t know what to do with it.",6,6,2025-12-19 07:08:44,NoBlackberry3295,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pq8hd7/my_therapist_said_they_cant_help_me_because_i/,therapy,0.88,Advice Wanted,-0.9998,-0.057567219817219815,-0.7582982778549194,0,-0.6906025828909037,-1
1pq1ymc,I've done so many horrible things and I can't live with myself.,"**TW: COCSA, mentions of sexual harassment, and other sexual themes in general.**

20M here. This is gonna be a pretty long rant filled with a lot of sensitive topics. Probably best that you don't read this if you're easily triggered by things.

I also want to start by saying that I suspect I have OCD. I don't have a diagnosis, but according to dozens of people, my obsessive thinking lines up very well with having OCD.

Point is, I've been a disgusting piece of shit my entire life, and I can't cope with it. The realization that I'm the same as the ""Disgusting male"" stereotypes is destroying me, because that doesn't align with my values.

But maybe I should explain how I came to this conclusion. Buckle in, because this is gonna be long.

Let's start from the earliest moments of messed up stuff. For context, I lived in an incredibly neglectful household. Parents did heroin and cocaine for years under our noses, had their drug addict friends stay with us all the time. I was always encouraged to seek out sex and to do drugs at a young age.

I was a perpetrator of COCSA when I was young. Not gonna give details, obviously, but my brother and my friend at the time were the victims I know for a fact I had. Though there are dozens of false memories tied to this as well that I can't say for sure they did or did not occur.

I had largely forgotten this ever happened. And I assume my brother did, as well, as he acts normal around me to this very day. I hope he doesn't remember. It's not like I can prove if he does or not.

Around the same time, I was taken advantage of by adults online after basically advertising myself as a sexually curious child. I willingly sent images of myself to these adults, and I got hooked on the feeling of validation. I'd do this with pretty much anybody for 3 years. Adults, people my age, it didn't matter. I've probably hurt dozens of people, since people would start getting feelings for me, and I'd just block them.

I ended up getting involved with my brother's group of drug addicted friends at around 14. Messed up group, that one. Some 17 year old girl was the head of the group. Was always having sex with this 14 year old dude when we would show up, and her mom would supply us with alcohol.

I was trying my hardest to be ""cool"" because I felt I had to be. I hated that I was some geek that liked video games. I never ended up having sex, thank god, but I did get my first and only kiss from that girl I mentioned before.

I tried to straighten myself out at around the age of 16, tried to bury my past as deep as I could bury it, and try to move on. I ended up developing what I believe is POCD after all of this. I can't be around or interact with any underage people without getting flashbacks.

Burying everythingworked for a while, until I went to college. I ended up dropping out and isolating myself in my room, which I'm still doing to this day.

I ended up getting incredibly close with my friend during this time. Shes my best friend in the whole world.

But I've been such a pervert towards her. Such a creepy bastard because I don't really know how to be ""normal"". I've never had a ""normal"" relationship with women. It's always had something to do with sex.

I've made so many creepy comments, talked about sexual things with her... Basically sexual harassment. She tells me that I'm overreacting, that it's really not a big deal, but I can't accept that answer. I feel disgusting.

Especially since I've become convinced that I tried to deliberately touch her inappropriately at one point. I can't prove that I did, but I also can't prove that I didn't. I hate how the memory is so... Fragmented and foggy. Why can't I know for sure?!

She tells me that I'm such a great person. That I'm unable to see myself the way she does. That even if I was a creep towards her (She doesn't think I have been), my good qualities more than make up for it. According to her, I'm honest with my emotions with her, I'm kind and always have made sure she's ok.

She even says she'd be willing to date me if I weren't so unstable.

She talks all the time about how she wants me to move in with her. How she wants me to get out of my toxic household so I can finally heal. But I don't trust myself. Not anymore. I thought I was being normal around her for so long.

I tried ghosting her a few months ago. I couldn't handle the idea that I've taken advantage of her, on top of the unwanted intrusive thoughts I get.

She eventually rallied up my other friends and did an online wellness check on me. Her, the victim in my perspective of my story, checking in on ME. To make sure I'M ok. Why?

I don't know. The only thing I know is I want to be a good person. I've cried so many times these past few months. Cried multiple times hust yesterday. The idea that I could have caused so much pain, and potentially more that I don't even remember... It hurts. I just want to be a good person.",13,7,2025-12-19 02:25:56,ThrowRA-Bromine,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pq1ymc/ive_done_so_many_horrible_things_and_i_cant_live/,therapy,0.85,Vent / Rant,0.9648,0.13898482469911042,-0.6836716532707214,1,-0.024598861695538654,0
1pqeoff,I'm so tired.,"I have a pile of issues that have impacted me throughout my life. I know the causes of some of them, I just don't know how to combat them. I feel as though I am two different people in the same body, as I would find myself talking one way, then the other. Or supporting one thing, then supporting the opposite. I'm so indecisive and don't feel like myself half the time.

I grew up disabled and with a rough family. Had to deal with religious issues, along with mental and physical disabilities, and confusion frustrates me.

I have emotional issues. I get bitter or sad easily. I rant to myself constantly, uncontrollably. I obssess over people who are kind to me. Every time I feel like I'm growing, I end up falling back down again. 

I'm also stuck in life. My anxiety and depression is so bad, along with the constant fatigue, that it gets really hard trying to do anything. A lot of broken dreams and trauma has effected me and haunted me and my disabilities limit me. I used to be able to run before I developed one of them, but now I feel so tired and achy that its hard to go on walks, and afraid that due to my disabilities, getting a normal job could pose serious risks. I also eat alot due to stress and lack of self control that it added weight just makes it worse.

And I'm afraid to do anything because I'm afraid that any decision or action I make will be wrong or a mistake. I'm afraid that if I pursue anything or fight against limitations, that will make my disabilities worse or that I would be punished for trying, partly because that is exactly what happened.

This is just the tip of the ice berg. I just needed a place to get some of it off my chest and around where others can read this. I wish I had the courage and strength to actually live life. I wish I wasn't disabled and trapped.",2,0,2025-12-19 12:33:02,randomthrowaway20251,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pqeoff/im_so_tired/,therapy,1.0,Vent / Rant,-0.9854,-0.12373163452708907,-0.8461450338363647,-1,-0.7434388438236001,-1
1pqhvf7,Therapy literally doesn’t work on me.,"I’ve been seeing therapists since I was about 4. I was diagnosed autistic as a kid but it was mostly sensory issues. I’m 21 now, and I haven’t been to a therapist since I was about 18 or 19. As I’ve gotten older though I really feel that I don’t get anything out of it. I don’t remember much about what I did in therapy before I was like 12 except that a lot of it felt like just playing with toys and games or coloring until the hour was up. I had one consistent therapist before she retired but looking back on it, she wasn’t a very great therapist because she overlooked a lot of the issues my mom had and perpetuated onto me and targeted and blamed my dad for all my problems (he was not the problem), and she honestly was a misandrist. I’ve had better therapists than her but I went through so many different diagnoses and then misdiagnoses that at one point I was diagnosed with six different mental illnesses and when I asked that therapist for a psychiatrist referral so that I could get a second opinion she ghosted me. Now as an adult I only see a psychiatrist and she says I have C-PTSD and OCD and that’s about it. 

As for therapists I tried later in my life, a lot of the time it just felt like I was explaining to them exactly what was wrong to me and them just telling me how self aware I am and I didn’t get anything out of it. So after awhile I’ve stopped seeing anyone except my psychiatrist and I’m on medication and that’s it. My dad and some other family members keep saying it’s important for me to go to therapy but every time I do I just end up really frustrated and I feel like the tools or advice they try to give me doesn’t help at all. (For instance; one therapist I had told me that because I have an intense fear of being followed or stalked that I should try playing tag or hide and seek with friends. Like sorry that is NOT the same.) 

Maybe it’s me, but I just really don’t know why it doesn’t work. It’s not like I’m closed off to getting help if I need it but I really think therapy just doesn’t work at me at all.

1pq9xc5,Loving myself.,"I, 17m, recently had a crush. She's beautiful, funny, and her voice is soooo attractive to me. In september, I told her I liked her and we had a long talk alone. It started off with her talking about how her last bf gave her trust issues, and that she's not in the right place for a relationship. I told her not to worry and explained how I understood, and we talked for the rest of the period.

Fast forward to october, and I said a line that involved me saying she was the only girl I liked (this was over text. I'm not going to add context). She responded by saying that's not something friends say to each other. I didn't see the problem with that at the time but then my friend told me that that was a pretty weird and lowk disrespectful response considering I already made it known that I had feelings for her. Me and her are friends still but I talk to her less. Not because I'm butt hurt about her decision (I make sure to not be the typa person who doesn't respect a womans choice), I just feel that as long as i have these feelings for her, itll continue putting her in awkward situations, but if ima be real, I think that's just an excuse I'm making for myself. Being around her, knowing I can't ever be with her, hurts. My thought process, I guess, is that if I step back for a while, I can lose the feelings I have for her. I'm sure now that she doesn't have feelings for me but theres always a liked reel with context that might be alluding to me, or her sending a picture of her and her cat, or even a pastconvo we had where she brought up me sharing a pfp with a girl whos my friend (which honestly seemed like the most open shot for me. Like cmon, no person who sees you as a friend is going to bring that up to you outta the blue) that pulls me back into the delusion that she likes me back.

I told my friends and they just said the things easier said than done like finding a new girl or just ghosting her completely, but my sister said something that actually piqued my interest, ""You just need to love yourself"". I don't know why it hit so hard. Please, can someone help me know what it means to love myself and how to let these feelings for her die?

1pqgmqi,Looking for serious advice,"Hi people,

Little about me, I am 23M, working in tech in NCR and comfortable financially

What is the purpose of your day? I am currently living alone (sort of, no interaction with flatmates). I go to the gym in morning, and go to office. But I dread coming back home. There is nothing to do. You can say I can watch series/books but I don't enjoy it much. Once a week is fine, but I don't feel that excitement anymore regarding anything now. There is nothing which excites me that yes, I want to do this after going back to flat. I absolutely dread weekends for this reason as there is no purpose or no excitement for anything.

I have recently gone through a breakup too, so while these issues persisted before too, now all of them have amplified many folds.

How do I figure out myself? How do I build up excitement for things? Without these things, even working feels meaningless, why am I working, why I am earning, what's the point of all this?

  
The only thing which I genuinely enjoy is having goof time with friends, or bakchodi as we call it. But not everyone is available all the time as we all grow up, and this dependency also doesn't feel correct

1pqgipd,Boyfriends coworker has poor boundaries and oversharing at work,"My partner (27M) and I (33F) have been in a relationship for 2.5 years. He has a female coworker that he started working with 2 years ago. They work as therapists in a small clinic. I first heard of her when they started studying together for their exams. About a year ago he said she influenced him to go vote in the last election. Which I thought was great. Then he told me she invited him to go to a protest with her and her friends, that I was welcome to come also. This is when I started asking questions about their friendship, because he has a complicated mental health history of PTSD with cops. I told him I couldn’t believe he would consider it since protests can be dangerous.

She called him twice outside of work on the weekend and after work, and he talked to her for like 30 min about work drama. I expressed how I felt these conversations should stay within work hours, but let it go because I didn’t really feel like I had a leg to stand on, just a bad feeling. Then a couple months later, he comes home and tells me she confided in him about having depression and suicidal thoughts, and she fired her therapist. She was clearly distressed and asked him to check on her. So he would walk by come to her office more often to check in. I told him that my bad feeling was growing and that he needs to have better boundaries with her, he can talk to her at work, but I do not want it escalating to taking calls from her after work or on weekends when we are supposed to be spending time together. He listened to me.

A few days later he comes home and tells me she thinks she has an eating disorder because she hasn’t been eating, she asks him if she can set up an appointment with me (I’m a dietitian with ED experience). I told him to tell her no and give her resources for eating disorder dietitians. To my understanding, she never followed up.

A month or so later, Boyfriend went out of the country for 3 weeks. The day he gets back, she goes into his office and tells him she took a week off work while he was gone, went on a date with a guy who somehow looked at her address on her ID from her wallet when she wasn’t looking, invaded her home, graped and strangled her. She asked him to do EMDR on her because she feels comfortable with him and thinks doing it with a guy will help her process what happened. My boyfriend asked me what I wanted him to do, and I told him I have empathy for her, but that he’s not the right person and it’s too close. she should see someone else she doesn’t work with because it creates a dual relationship. It could end up being more than one session after work, or she may need to do emdr for related traumas. Where would it stop? So he told her today that he can’t have a dual relationship with a coworker, and gave her resources for other therapists. He said she took it well, but she said she would keep the other therapists in mind. I hate to sound like a bad person but this is all so fishy to me. It does not seem like she wants to do emdr with anyone else, and may never have been interested in the emdr. I want to know what you guys think of her behavior. Was she just trying to get close to him however she could?

In 7th I loved a girl in 7th std in november and in summer vacation i couldn't message her for two days as my eldest brother is coming from Canada so while tht time I got a call from my best friend let me name him 'A'. So he told me tht she wanted breakup and I got angry and told her okay and we broke up. 


In summer vacation i didn't talked about her I was happy I didn't care about her and when the school started I wanted to let her know her mistake but I couldn't give up on her. I loved her more than i realised ( I know it's cringe considering my age but still facts😂🙂) and I wanted to get in a relationship with her again .



She was asking me for one more chance but I didn't give her it because the reason she told for breakup was she got bored and I got upset about it. But after I started messaging her and asked her the reason thn she told me he got bored then but not now and I was happy tht she ain't bored now, but people told me tht was bad but I don't understand till now. And we started messaging we messaged like couples but not officially and all .



And one after football practice, her house is in the same route as mine so I saw her and we kissed and touched her breasts and she was happy about it. And I decided to be in a relationship with her officially and I told it to my friend A and then he told me tht she had proposed him in that time and I got really angry and ghosted her. And in 8th she was asking me chances but I never gave and then I met the other friend 'N' . He was my second best friend.

So in these times to show my ex 'M' I got committed with a new admission girl. And In 8th with my friend 'N' I started smoking , i always thought about M and I smoked and in 9th  I understood tht I never had feeling for the new girl and told her tht we can continue this in 9th if we felt and she told she has been thinking the same and it was her idea. And in 9th I got committed with another named 'T' and I one day with my friends we went to her house while they were sitting outside we kissed and I touched her breasts.




I only told this to my bestfriend N and he was my bestfriend and the friend A got committed with M my ex and I never really cared bout it. And I also told N about me and M's history. So in 9th after December my friend started mocking me by saying bout M's thing and all. And I never cared cause they are my friends. And in that time N told this to A and he too joined them but he never knew it was about M. And I always told them don't say it. I have girl bf, we have been friends from kindergarten.



So naturaly i introduced her to N and we became close friends and after 9th holidays I started noticing tht everyone was avoiding me including my girl bf. Even N, I was with him for 3 years when his leg broke I went everyday and all.oneday my friend A called me told the truth.


N was stabbing me behind my back. He told everyone about my history,he betrayed my trust, he told everyone tht I wanted every girls and I want to use them. Even my girl bf believed it and I had another girl friend not gf just girl friend. And we were so close I made her committed to my another friend . And after some time N told him I wanted her and I will use her and all. And slowly he stopped talking to me i stopped talking to her she stopped talking to me.


All while this our family's financial state was bad we have to sell our house to surive as we have 1 cr debt . And in August due some circumstances N got exposed and I asked him everything and he denied it .he got beating from many seniors due to some things he said to them and he lost his image . He was committed with my girl bf along with two other girls and my gf have snapped me her breasts pics and I told him about tht earlier and he let everyone know.



And while all this happening he told A tht I used her girl and our history so when he asked her M told I forced her and A told me i abused her, traumatized her and all and he told to the school vice principal.and  the teachers asked tht whether I have mothe oru sister and all , I got to known as someone like tht and he told to me and my gf tht I'm using her and I got sad after hearing all this.even my gf got to breakup with me but didn't (still in a relationship).


Then I everything is now normal N got what he deserved and If got a image in school and many people called N and told him if he lay a finger on me they'll chop his hand which got everyone thought tht I have so gang and all. And now I got nothing to be scared off but I recently came to know tht A is a spy got our vice principal and he told everything to him. So I can't trust him.



So my question is  Am I a man who uses girls for their body?, who do I trust? Am I the bad guy and my brain is just justifying me as the victim ?. I want to know the answers so I came to u guys cause you'll give me a reality check and all .

1pqctem,Why do therapists brush off the loss of a pet?,"I’ve been going to therapy since I was raped and learning to cope with that was the main goal to work towards but when my cockatiel died in July I was absolutely crushed. Every pain I ever felt up to that point felt like needle pricks compared to the moment I found out my bird had passed away alone and I didn’t get to say goodbye.

My rape was easy to rationalize. It was not my fault. He was a terrible person. Period. 

My great grandmothers death was easy to process. She was 94. We took care of her and she lived a good, long life.

My miscarriage is still a huge source of pain but even then, I know deep down that as happy as I was to find out I was pregnant, I just wasn’t ready for a baby.

But my bird was only 7. He was sick and I didn’t catch it in time. He should’ve lived well into his 20’s but instead he died alone. I wasn’t even there to comfort him.

He was my whole world and my reason to get out of bed. I still cry about him often. With Christmas coming up, I get so terribly sad because he loved Christmas. He’d stare at the ornaments and sit in his own little spot and rip the wrapping paper up. 

And whenever I brought up grief for my bird when she was asking how I was doing, my therapist would brush it off and bring up something “more traumatic” to work on.

1ppwvu3,"Looking for therapist perspective: long-term loneliness, attachment, and self-worth","Hi,
I’m posting here specifically hoping for responses from therapists / psychologists / mental health professionals.

I’ve been struggling with long-term loneliness and attachment issues since childhood. I tend to over-give emotionally, make others my center, and feel intense sadness or emptiness when I’m not emotionally connected to someone. Even small care (like someone asking “how are you”) affects me deeply.

This pattern has repeated across relationships and friendships. I often feel like I’m on the outside socially, and when someone pulls away, my self-worth collapses. I also carry a lot of self-criticism and exhaustion from “trying to be okay” for years.

I’m not looking for diagnosis or reassurance, and I understand Reddit is not therapy. I’m already planning professional help. I’m looking for professional perspectives on:

What core patterns might be driving this (attachment, emotional neglect, dependency, etc.)

What evidence-based approaches help build self-regulation and internal identity

What kind of therapy/modalities are usually effective for this profile

What not to focus on, so I don’t keep repeating the same cycle


For context:

Adult male

Currently on fluoxetine (Prodep) 20 mg and Zincovit

No substance use

Main issue is emotional/relational, not situational


I’m not looking for DMs, medical advice, or relationship coaching — just grounded professional insight.

However I kinda hate some of the stuff like an “emotional support taco” in a jar or a “positivity mushroom” because that’s just mindless consumerism. How is that supposed to increase mental health? 

Even worse she called it a self care package in a text message. Oh dear. Self care isn’t make up bags, face masks, or stickers or pins or novelty toys. Honestly tooth brushes and vouchers for free health care services would have been better if it’s a self care package. It’s sweet but I needed nothing she gave me so to call it self care feels disingenuous. 

Am I ungrateful? Overthinking it? Too cynical? 

And no I’m not voicing this opinion to her. I don’t want to hurt her feelings. But stuff like this is just making therapy seem like a pointless money making venture under neo liberal pull yourself by your bootstraps capitalism and not anything that will help me in any way

1pq7o8n,How do I break my pattern of making the closest person to me my everything?,"I have many friends and a few close ones. The closest girl gives me emotional fulfillment others don't and I can't help but want it more.

I started developing romantic feelings again cause of this as I had only felt intense closeness for the first time in a romantic setting so despite whatever position I'm in if closeness has intimacy even platonically I'll start feeling romantic feelings *sigh*

I'm watching myself slowly make her the center of my being again (we're on a break btw so my feelings dull out as I'm not ready for a relationship). The deep jealousy has returned as well and all kinds of fears.

I don't know why do I need to have a figure in my life who is at the center of everything? Wanna take their name when I need comfort like a child calling his mother. I constantly feel the need to have a strong guide in my life who I rely on and do everything for. 

I don't like depending on them cause that makes me feel even more useless cause I'm unable to help them or give back as much as they gave me. I can't live upto that.

How do I manage relying on a person and also on myself but without making the closest person to me the goddess I start worshipping and attaching whoever I am to them?

By worshipping I mean that I imagine for hours talking with them and thinking of them. Also, this thing doesn't reduce instead it increases and stays that way for months even years. I attach my worth to how much I'm able to give back then the comparison starts. You can't give enough or I'm not enough of this or that ugh.

When these feelings come up I just stay with them as I know they'll go away cause they're just distorting some things.

I'm trying to increase my interaction with more of my friends but I'm going crazy again. Re-reading messges and stalking how their friends are with her. I don't remember ever not being in a position where I don't have a person like this and each time they were just a close friend I ended up falling for.

What am I looking for and how do I give it to myself? I'm ready to do be uncomfortable and face myself. How do I do that? How do I break this pattern?

1pq28pm,I have a close friend who's been through a lot and is struggling to navigate the healthcare system to find a therapist.  Looking for advice.,"Hi! My friend is in her 30s, a victim of long-term molestation by a close family member and at a very low point in her life professionally and romantically.  She's been ousted from a consistent living situation and as a result, her health insurance will not be able to give her coverage for a regular therapist until February.  She uses 988 in times of crisis, but the underlying problems from her childhood coupled with her current situation are compounding her misery and self-hate. 

  
Is there a resource that can be used to find a relatively inexpensive (or pro-bono) therapist to do tele-health appointments with her temporarily until she has access to insurance again?  I know for certain that she's open to it, she just doesn't know what else to do at this point.

1pq741y,"Is it ADD, BPD, Anxiety, Romantic Orientation, or Commitment Issues?","To be entirely open and honest, I have been diagnosed with ADD, Borderline Personality Disorder, Chronic Anxiety, Depression, C-PTSD, and Bipolar Mood Disorder. I am 26, trans masculine non-binary (if that matters at all).
Since I was a young child, I have always loved the idea of love, I have always had lots of crushes on people in my life, no matter their gender. But also had a massive fear about it. Since I have started actually dating (16 y/o) I have begun to notice a pattern. I fall in love fast, and I fall in love hard. I've always desired to find the one person that is out there for me (which I believe I do have now). The pattern I have noticed is after some time in the relationship (usually after the first real fight) I start to have wish washy feelings. When I'm around my person (physically in the same space), I'm in love with them, no question in my head. But when we are not physically in the same space, my mind starts to question the entire relationship. Am I good for them? Are they good for me? My brain begins to nitpick all of the things that have gone wrong and I question my entire relationship.
For the first 6 months of this current relationship I have had a strong feeling that we were literally made to love each other, in the way he treats me, and the way I treat him. The last month or so (after our first fight) I have had questions. Questioning our sexual capability, questioning his feelings for me, and whether or not he's lied to me. Things that didn't seem to bother him before about me, seem to cause a reaction from him now, and vice versa.
I recently (in the last couple of weeks) had a nasty BPD episode where I basically told him that I am no good for him and he should get out and run. He wasn't working at the time, so it was me going to work, coming home, we spend time together, go to sleep, do it all over again.
This week he started working and it's created a distance between us. He struggles to communicate his honest feelings after a long day, I'm noticing that there are pieces of myself I have shut out as it makes him uncomfortable/insecure, and I'm starting to reach a point where I'm questioning it all. I want to work through this, as it's obviously something wrong with me. It's throwing my head for a loop to be in love with him at home, but question everything with I'm at work. I even recently told him that I hate being in relationships with my BPD as it is constantly making me feel insecure about everything.
My main question is, do I have commitment issues? Is this a long game for my BPD? It's not him, otherwise I wouldn't have experienced this in the past with other relationships I have been in. I just feel lost, and extremely confused. I feel like I shouldn't feel this way. Does anyone else experience this? Am I crazy? Am I mentally ill?

1pq6ecx,Can this toxic situation cause numbness and depression?,"TW

We were together for five years. There were good times, I guess, but there were also so many times I was genuinely scared of him. Times when I felt completely powerless and alone. Things would be fine and then something horrible would happen, and afterwards he’d act like nothing ever happened. I started questioning if I was remembering things right, if I was losing my mind.

I’ve been avoiding saying this, but I think the relationship was abusive. And now I’m in this awful place where I feel torn apart inside. I don’t want to destroy his life - he has nothing. No money, nowhere stable to live, serious mental health problems. But what he did to me was horrible. I can’t just pretend it didn’t happen.

His family either ignores what he does or makes excuses for him. When I try to talk about it, they make me feel like I’m crazy - not just him, but them too. It makes me doubt everything.

Here’s what I know happened:

One time I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.

He pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.

He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I said no, he kept shoving it at me until it spilled everywhere, then he slapped me and called me a stupid bitch. Said I was the problem.

He got drunk and stormed into my apartment screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my stuff around, ripped my shirt off me, and held me down. My roommate had to physically kick him out.

The first time he grabbed my throat, I was half-naked. I had to do a Zoom meeting after with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up later, he said it was sexual and that I was exaggerating.

He wouldn’t drive me to work unless we had sex first. If I cried or was running late, he’d threaten to just leave me there.

During sex, when he got frustrated or couldn’t get hard, he’d pinch me hard, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a bitch.

Once he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.

He drove like a maniac, pulling my hair and saying we were both going to die because I talked about leaving him. I had a complete panic attack.

He choked me. Multiple times. Not for long, but long enough to scare the hell out of me.

He wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.

His cousin heard me crying during a fight and came in to check. He got even more pissed and blamed me for letting someone see me like that.

When his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt so humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.

He used to “check” me to see if I’d been with other guys, while he was out there cheating on me.

He bit my face when he was angry and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.

I think early in our relationship he did something sexual to me when I was half-asleep after getting high. It’s fuzzy but it still haunts me.

If I said something hurt or that I wanted to stop during sex, he’d laugh at me, say I was lying, or just keep going.

He called me a cheater for wanting to hang out with friends or family. Meanwhile he was the one lying and cheating.

I hate admitting this, but sometimes I just gave in to sex because I was scared of what would happen if I said no. I’d cry during it or after and feel like my body wasn’t mine anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or made me stay in positions until he was done with whatever he was doing.

One time the neighbors heard me crying and him screaming. He was throwing things, yelling threats through the wall, saying he’d kill them. Later he blamed me for the whole thing.

So why do I still feel so confused about everything?

He’s been through trauma. He has mental health issues. Part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that makes what he did okay.

Is this actually abuse? Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he wouldn’t let me stop?

I feel like I’m losing my mind trying to understand it all. And I still feel guilty. I can’t make myself report anything - he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left him. But I’m still carrying around all this pain and I don’t know what to do with it.",1,1,2025-12-19 05:31:18,NoBlackberry3295,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pq6ecx/can_this_toxic_situation_cause_numbness_and/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,-0.9998,-0.057567219817219815,-0.8236801028251648,-1,-0.7232934953760264,-1
1pq4q8v,How do I tell my IOP team I need to switch back to my old therapist?,"Hi everyone. I’m in IOP and could use some advice about a therapist situation.

*TL;DR:* Previous IOP therapist called EMS on me and I used that as a way to get discharged from the clinic by switiching to a new IOP therapist so I could off myself without anyone being liable. Since my previous therapist knew I wasn't ready to be discharged, I got switched to a new therapist so it'd be easier to get discharged (since they didn't know me or my history). Now, I actually want the help to not off myself but I can't open up as well with my current IOP therapist. 

Ahout 5 to 6 weeks ago, I switched to a different therapist after a safety escalation (therapist called EMS on me). At the time, I told myself the switch would help me get discharged faster, but honestly, that decision came from a really hopeless place, not from wanting to do the work. Now that I actually want to get better, I can see that starting over with a new therapist has made it much harder to open up or be honest. I find myself performing wellness just to get through sessions.

The issue is that:

I was the one who requested the switch

several staff (including the director) were involved

and now I feel awkward or “difficult” for wanting to switch back


I don’t want to sound like I’m flip-flopping or blaming anyone. I just know I was more able to talk and get real help with my previous therapist, and I think that continuity matters for my safety and progress.

How can I bring this up in a way that’s honest and professional, especially when the original switch happened under complicated circumstances?
Has anyone ever switched back to a previous therapist within a program setting?

I was thinking of actually reaching out to my previous IOP therapist and telling her why I wanted the switch in the first place. I could also tell my current IOP therapist this since she's been noticing something is wrong, OR make an appointment with the program director and explain my thought process.",1,0,2025-12-19 04:18:06,Forsaken_Finding4145,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pq4q8v/how_do_i_tell_my_iop_team_i_need_to_switch_back/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,0.9908,0.05751893939393941,0.0,-1,0.30874378787878787,1

I’ve always tried shadow work journaling, but most of the time it felt like I was staying on the surface or circling the same thoughts. Lately, journaling has helped me slow down and go deeper. It’s helped me sit with uncomfortable thoughts, rephrase what I’m really feeling, and notice patterns I didn’t consciously see before. Some of what came up genuinely surprised me.

I’m also in shadow therapy, and this has made a real difference in how I show up to sessions. I feel more grounded and aware of what’s actually coming up for me, instead of trying to untangle everything in the moment.

I feel very little emotionally, and I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt genuinely happy or at peace.

My mind is constantly running, and my nervous system feels exhausted.

Socializing is difficult (i have some friends) But generally It feels like people  can sense something “off” in me, like an inner tension!! Dating almost always ends in ghosting (i think because of that ..)

From age 18 to 24, I lived in a country where life was extremely difficult for me. I stayed there to study even though it felt deeply wrong, because I had no real alternative. During those years I went through a lot of stress and CONTINEOUS problems, until I finally got a scholarship and left.

Only recently (almost 15 years later) I’ve started wondering whether that period may have affected my brain or nervous system more deeply than I realized. Before that, I thought this was just my personality.

Or may be it’s a CTPSD or something ? I don’t know !!

Some concrete things I experience:

    •	I feel almost no pleasure in anything
    
    •	I can’t relax like other people seem to
    
    •	I can’t watch a movie normally without checking my phone constantly and wanting it to end
    
    •	Even when I’m with friends, part of me wants the moment to be over
    
    •	My brain feels stuck in constant overdrive, without a clear reason

I’ve never been to a doctor or therapist for this. ((I have a strong mistrust, partly because I’ve read that some people feel worse after medication or therapy!! For some trauma reasons i don’t trust therapist too much))

1pppbkr,According to my doctor my depression is my fault,"My doctor blamed me for my depression

I had an appointment with my doctor today and explained that I feel that my depression and anxiety are getting worse and that I am having frequent suicidal thoughts and dificulty sleeping because of intrussive thoughts and rummination. Her response was that I am negative and that is why this is happening to me. That I had to read self-help books and try to self-heal. She also recommended I try a different therapeutic approach. I told her that I can't afford it. She then told me I had to learn to be alone and forget about my ex because she already moved on. She said this while knowing the whole story about our on and off relationship which has left me devastated. 
The issue with my ex is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many other things happening simultaneously in my life. She knows most of these other issues but still told me that my depression is my fault. 

The worst is that she agreed with my mother. One of the most cruel people I have ever met when she said to me last week that my ex moved on already and does not care about me. Then the doctor said that she and the therapist from that clinic are harsh on me because I am negative.

At the end she said, Oh, what I am going to do with you? I said, that is a good question. She ended up telling me that I have to go back to antidepresants (I have tappered them down with her help last year) and increased my anxiety medication. 

After this appointment I was left wondering, what is the purpose of seeing a doctor and having a therapist.

1ppu36u,Things I Noticed During Therapy -- Are these things normal or odd?,"Hi all, I started therapy a few months ago and have felt that my therapist is helpful. But also that he sometimes misinterprets things or falls back on stereotypes. I’ve never done therapy before this, so I’m not sure if these things that I observed are weird or normal. FYI, I’m an Asian female in their 20s. The therapist is not an Asian female in their 20s lol. 

  
First, he often mentions that I want to ""honor” my immigrant parents. I don’t deny wanting to make my parents proud (and I told my therapist about this). Still, I don’t think that this is an all-encompassing part of my personality (or even a significant part). Maybe it’s because I found it odd that he used the word ""honor.” I didn’t ascribe my feelings to this word, so it felt like a non-Asian was going off Asian stereotypes. It felt very Mulan-esque (‘bring honor to us all’). 

  
When determining what may have caused me to have anxious thoughts, I mentioned that I went to a super-competitive high school where my friends mostly attended Ivy League schools – and that, even though I attended a highly ranked public school, I didn’t feel on par with my peers. The therapist then asked whether the other students were Asian (he didn’t ask any follow-ups or explain why he asked this). His comment felt odd, like he was going off stereotypes about Asians being ultra-competitive and academically successful. 

I’m currently applying to grad programs and expressed that I feel anxious about the process. He then asked whether I would feel like a failure if I didn’t get into a top school.  If I didn’t get into a top program, I would probably reapply next cycle because my professors said that, if I want to go into academia/research, I need to go to a top-15 program. I tried explaining to him that doctorates are not like undergraduate degrees, in which going to any top 100 undergrad institution could \~ usually \~ get you a job in some field if you choose the right major, play your cards right, and have luck navigating the job market (which, I fully admit, is awful at the moment). In the field I want to go into, if your doctorate wasn’t from a top-30 school, your application won’t even be glanced over for academia/research roles. He brushed off these comments and kept saying I was being so anxious and high-strung about this process, almost giving the impression that I was driving myself crazy over these applications. Once again, I think he was going off stereotypes about Asians being ultra-competitive and having this ""Harvard or bust"" mentality.  

He would often start giving me his take on the state of the world, like the rising cost of college or other socioeconomic concerns. He also commented on my intonation and recommended that I pay more attention to how I dress if I want to get a doctorate. 

He would often 'diagnose' me, like mentioning that he thinks I have depression, anxiety, or an IQ over 140. I've never taken a test for these things. He also noted that I may have autism, and that he believes this because I’ve mentioned social anxiety and sensory overloads before. The thing is... I've never experienced or talked about social anxiety or sensory overloads with him. I know that it's hard to identify autism in females. Still, it felt like he was throwing diagnoses at the wall, trying to see if one would stick.

  
Anyways, I may be taking these comments more seriously than I need to, since I'm not a licensed or certified therapist.

1ppu2s8,"Life stuff I guess, couldn't put more flairs since I don't know how to but adivce is welcome.","I haven't really posted anywhere so if I break any rules that's probably why.

The page reset while I was typing so I had to redo this..

I know I'm young and I can't jump headfirst into life to do everything but it's already been a few months and I feel like I'm doing enough, I'll get burst of ""Hell yeah lets geterdone!"" but it'll fade within the day or the next. going from trying to start a garden, to powering sawing something in the middle of the night since I found a tree I thought I could use for something.

What I think is stopping me is that I don't want to get stuck in a loop but get stuck anyways, sure I could and get a job that'll pay solid gold but will I be happy with the day-to-day?  
If I go for somehing I think I want to do but figure I didn't actually want to do that, will I just be stuck since I already sunk too much time and effort into it?

So I haven't done anything and been stuck having my days be the same and I hate it, I want to do something and not end up with most of the people in my life with being stuck in vices.

I broke up with my Girlfriend yesterday which I expected to give a reaction that was more then just ""Yeah"", I expected to feel like shit but I sort of just am which I find concerning but not surprising since I haven't really expressed anything with events I should've, like nearly being drowned it was ""oh"" I could give more examples but it'll just turn into ""How are you here""

In the other version I had a way to bridge to this part but I can't remember how I did it so I'm just going to it.

We got together while I was still in school, around this time last year I asked a woman who worked in my school as a sort of teaching assistant for the kids with disablilites and those with mental illnessses about who I should try to get to know and eventually date since I was feeling down and wanting someone to be with since I kept seeing couples and I gave her 3 I thought I could have a chance with.

1 - Senior who I thought was somewhat interested in me but didn't know much about but wanted to grow a relationship with

2 - Girl in the same grade and most of the classes with me, she was extroverted but more on the quiet side but was a lot like me

3 - The girl I ended up with, I was interested in her since I saw her a few times and she was always bubbly and looked unique, she was the type of girl I'd say is my ""Type"" if it ever came up in conversation, also random note I added in after writing, I assumed she was either in the same grade or a senior, she wasn't and was younger then me which is why I was against certain things later in the rant.

We logicked (is that a word?) though the choices I had, 1 was talking to somebody, 2 was more school orientated seemingly so she probably wouldn't be interested (regardless she later was)

Then we got to the one I ended up with which we'll give a random name to, Alice, the woman told that she was also looking for someone since she was having a shitty year so I said I could try to talk to her (Which I didn't) so life went on after that.

A random tidbit is that I was silversmithing so I was interested in making a copper ring as a little gift for whoever I would choose and gave me the time of day so I also asked to see who I should get measurements for.

I would mostly stay in the Art room since most of my classes were there, I would either work on assignments or doodle in there for most the day, I would always be dead tired at school or busy with working with clay, Alice would hover around the room and sometimes get closer to me, while working I sort of space out and focus on what I'm working on which depending on angle looks really funny so I didn't really talk to her.

Week or two later we started to interact since she caught me when I wasn't either sleeping or working, I would still work on my things but talk to her while doing them, we'd eat lunch together and start spending time with each other until we exchanged socials.  
From then she'd come over to the art room and spend time with me until her next class started, always sitting next to me watching me like a puppy or poking at me.  
After school since we'd play online with each other on random games, first on xbox then steam since we lived about an hour apart since the school we go to is in a town which is sort of a middle point between us, first it was awkward since we didn't know what to talk about but it'd go into her joining my friend group and us playing all together.

Around the holidays we'd start to go on dates to the city which was a few hours away, we'd watch movies or walk around the mall since she liked to shop and I didn't mind if I was with her, nearing the new year we started to go to each others house, first it was movies and playing with the animals at her place, scribbling and being silly then napping together until we started being more intimate.

When we did I would always have second thoughts before and after about it but went with it since she wouldn't stop poking me about it, around this time I was thinking about how we were moving a bit too fast since it was had been a few months and I had said some things I wasn't sure about alongside her wanting me to get her pregnant during some of the times we were intimate (alongside doing it itself) but when I brought it up with her she got slightly annoyed and mad and I had to poke her to talk a few days afterwards, she pulled back more here but we fell back into in after the new year.

A part of why we did is because of course, it feels good but why I fell back into it is due to how it made me feel connected to someone, like I said before a lot of my family fell into vices and I didn't conenct to anyone so this was important for me.

So we continue dating until it starts to slow nearing June, when I graduated which I understood why, she wanted to be the best of the best, summa cum laude and whatnot sicne she wanted to make a difference, she'd always have something to do which made our schedules not align as much, I was fine with waiting to spend time with her but most of our dates just turned to us having sex then doing our own thing.

Eventually it slowed till now, she broke up with me and I didn't really feel much of anything, the more I thought about it the less it made sense, I should've felt something and even she was surprised, only few things on my mind was if she had someone else in mind, don't know if I was jealous or didn't want anyone to have her? or if it was morbid curiostiy,

Don't know, I don't know what I'm supposed to feel here but it should be something.

Maybe I'll rant again when I think about things again, maybe it'll be about something else dunno.

TL:DR guy complains about doing nothing and then rants.

1pptapu,How do i prepare myself for a new therapist?,"Hi all. i’ve been seeing my current therapist for around 3 years now. this is the first one i’ve been able to form a connection with, so needless to say i’m pretty bummed that he’s retiring in January (but i’m excited for him, of course). thankfully, he was able to recommend a new therapist he thinks i will enjoy, and she does seem like a good fit for me from what he’s told me. 
in this new chapter of my therapy journey, i’d like to be more prepared and organized with what i’m really there for. obviously i know why im there, but i’d like to find a way to help my new therapist understand who i am, what ive already accomplished, what still needs work. 
what are some ways i can do that? and if you’ve gone through the same experience, what did and didn’t work for you? i work best with the classic pen and paper, journaling, and lists if that’s any help. or, maybe i’m thinking about it too much which is also a possibility.

Throughout my life, I’ve been told I’m a failure, stupid, or dumb. My Narcissistic mother is the worst, and has never praised me or said well done. When I told her my good news, she brushed it off, and said everyone gets into med school (?!).

1ppnswe,Feeling unsure about my new therapist’s comments/approach and would love some input,"Hi, I’ve had 3 sessions with a new therapist and I’m not sure if I want to continue. I’ve been struggling to find a therapist who I like for a year and have been through about 4, and don’t want to start fresh if I can help it. 

There’s been a few things this current therapist has done that made me unhappy or uncomfortable, and I’m not sure how seriously to take it or how to bring it up in our next session. 

1- I am trans, they are not. I’ve experienced consistent and at times significant medical transphobia and gatekeeping. The therapist believes that doctors have a duty to help me and doesn’t seem to understand that if I go to a doctor and ask for help with anything, related to my gender or not, there is a very real chance I’ll be mistreated and denied help. 

When I gave my pronouns as binary pronouns, the therapist made a comment about having other clients who used mixed pronouns and that they ‘didn’t get it’. If I had given mixed pronouns, I imagine I wouldn’t have been privy to that comment, and I felt it was inappropriate and heightened the distance between us.

2- I am disabled, the therapist is disabled and disabled community focused. I feel a lot of shame about not masking my disability in public, and have been bullied for displaying signs of it before. It feels the therapist jumps straight to ‘who cares what they think, just live for you’ without properly engaging in the lived experience, shame, or problems I have with self-advocacy. 

3- The therapist interrupts me while I’m speaking sometimes, and I don’t feel like it’s at appropriate points, like to interrupt a genuine spiral. 

4- I told the therapist I need routine and that therapy is difficult for me. We agreed to keeping the same timeslot each week. Last week, they asked late the night before to reschedule. Trying to accommodate this went poorly for me, and resulted in a shutdown and a missed week of therapy. I later learned the therapist did not request the change because of an illness or family commitment, which would have been totally acceptable to me, but to go on a radio show. 

I’d really appreciate yalls thoughts on this and how I might address it in our next session. I don’t want to just quit the therapy, and feel even if I discontinue with this therapist, it would probably be an important exercise for me to bring up complaints.

1ppel0s,I think I can officially say I've lost the fight. I give up. There's just no hope left,"I'm 18, and I've been fighting depression since I was a very small child. My parents were horrible in my childhood and made it worse, and then ignored all of the signs. I grew up feeling unloved, abandoned, scared, and alone because of them and everyone I've met so far has only furthered those feelings. 

Friends, girlfriends, even family have all treated me horribly for years. A couple years ago, I found a girl that I thought would break the cycle. I thought she would be the first to love me, but I was wrong and she used me. I was with her for two years and she was in an even worse spot than me. But I helped her out of it and then she abandoned me. She didn't care about me. 

It's just been everyone. My entire life. And right now, I don't have people that care. I just want it all to end. I'm tired of feeling like this every f*cking day. I've lost. I just can't fight anymore. I don't know if I could have the balls to do it myself but I want to so badly. I'm on anti depressants, I'm in counseling but nothing helps. My life is f*cked and has been from the start. I have tried to be the best person I can be and no one has done anything but exploit that. No one has loved me. 

I just don't think there's a way out of this. Everyone says it gets better. Everyone says it's temporary, but they are wrong. It's been my whole life. My entire life I wish I wasn't here, and it feels like everyone else wants that same thing. This doesn't get better. And if eventually it will, I think it will be too late for me.

1ppge7b,A story from my childhood,"This was during quarantine I was ten at the time and I was in zoom class on the couch. 

I don’t remember how it started but my mom was angry at my two brothers like usually maybe for bad grades or something. So she told the to go downstairs in the basement, it’s where they slept. It had mold and was scary so I never went downstairs but regardless she was yelling at them to go downstairs. 

Of course I was muted and she’s telling to go downstairs but she has a belt, and every time they tried to go downstairs she’d hit them with the belt. Eventually she let my second older brother down stairs after like to hits. But with my oldest brother she had a grudge against him his entire life I think because he looked awfully similar to my dad. 

So, he’s begging to go downstairs and she’s saying go downstairs but would hit him and block his path. 

And I’m sitting there watching scared cause what if she keeps hitting him. To me you get punished for doing bad but he didn’t do anything bad to deserve this much. 

But at the same time my sisters laughing likes it’s funny it wasn’t to me I was terrified. 

Then I remembered the computer and how with a click of a button I could’ve let my teacher hear about this.

1pp9e11,My husband lies and gets mad at me for invalidating his perspective,"Is there any type of couples therapy that we can go to that will help us address this dynamic? 

There's an issue where my husband will say something that is objectively false and then get mad at me if I point out that is objectively false. He sometimes says that these things are his"" perspective"" or his ""reality"" and says that I am gaslighting him by telling him that he is not accurate. If I have factual proof that he is wrong, he will tell me that it's normal to remember things incorrectly and it's not a big deal or he'll invalidate the proof somehow, such as by saying that recordings of voices often pick things up selectively and can't be trusted. 

My husband will often start with some sort of jumped-to conclusion presented as an objective fact and if I point out that it is a conclusion and not necessarily true and ask him how he arrived at that conclusion, he sometimes invents facts that either did not happen in reality or that are not possible. Sometimes he jumbles timelines of things that really did happen. 

I used to record virtually all of our important conversations just so that I had a record to check for myself when he told me that I was remembering incorrectly, and I was shocked by how accurate my recollection actually was because for years I had been told (by him) that I had serious issues with remembering things accurately, and I had come to really believe it. Our most recent couples therapist told me to stop recording things though because it was making him upset and because I was not giving him the benefit of the doubt. (He hates being recorded or putting things in writing.)

He also draws conclusions of events he was not present at and passes them off as fact. As a minor example, he recently stated that I never use my work desk. He's not around when I work. I work from home and he does not, and he has no firsthand knowledge of where I work when I am at home. He just decided this. 

He also told me that his parents don't yell at me even though he was out of the house for 12 hours everyday and they very much did in fact yell at me. When I asked if I could record his parents, he got pissed at me. 

He used to often tell me what my emotions were and what my motivations were. I've started standing up every single time that he does this and telling him he's wrong. At first he said that I was gaslighting him because I was invalidating his perspective because he ""felt like"" I was upset or trying to manipulate him (etc.), but now he has mostly stopped telling me how I feel. 

He also gets upset with me if I am hurt by his behavior and he recently told me ""you being hurt by me is a dealbreaker for me"". He later told me that I should have interpreted what he said in the most favorable light to him and what he really meant was that he does not want to hurt me. Also, if I raise an issue or something he did (in reality) that hurt me, he often responds by saying he is offended I would think he would do that or by inventing something that I did to hurt him (sometimes too vague for me to understand, sometimes totally untrue, and sometimes factual but several years old or seemingly unrelated). 

He's great to be around 98% of the time, but I never know when he's going to have one of these meltdowns.

1ppcd83,I don’t understand what I need,"So I suffer from social anxiety and GAD, and basically have very low self worth. It seems to stem from negative experiences in adolescence when I was bullied and socially excluded. We tried a bit of a schema approach but I found I was resisting a lot because I feel that I have a lot of evidence to justify feeling like I’m not good enough. 
So we did one session of EMDR where we focused on a negative bullying memory. But honestly I felt NOTHING. I was just like to my therapist - I don’t understand how this is supposed to help, it was ten years ago, I’m not really upset about that specific situation anymore…but I still don’t feel good enough. 

She also gives me a lot of practical advice for my social anxiety like sharing more with people at work etc and I even went to a social event with strangers solo. But it certainly doesn’t change how I feel. 

I just don’t know what therapy I actually need or how I can be helped. ",2,2,2025-12-18 05:33:19,Silver_Guarantee_804,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1ppcd83/i_dont_understand_what_i_need/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,0.9168,0.07355889724310777,-0.8399176001548767,-1,-0.13020702062881684,0
1ppgorx,Can I tell my therapist about hallucinations and drug use without her thinking I need to be hospitalized?,"Sorry if this post seems incoherent, I once again have been awake for several days. 

I started therapy in August after my doctor made me meditate because my blood pressure was so high that they were going to call an ambulance if I didn't get it down. My blood pressure is super high even though I'm only in my mid-20s due to a significant amount of stress in the last year caused by many things, but primarily a lawsuit for eight times what I make in a year. 

Anyways, it's the first time that I've been to therapy since I was 6, so I'm not really sure if I can tell my therapist the full extent of my hallucinations and drug abuse, and one of my biggest fears dating back to childhood has been being locked in a mental asylum. 

The main reason I haven't told her is because I'm afraid that once I say that she will think I belong in a mental hospital. But I really don't think it's that serious. I've been having these hallucinations not due to a separate mental problem, but due to insomnia which is kind of periodic and about one week a month I will experience 5ish days with no sleep and have hallucinations toward the end of that. It is notable that I always know the hallucinations aren't real, and they are usually something friendly like an animated Disney character or a pokémon. I also have some related to hppd that I haven't told her about, but that's a separate thing. 

As for my drug abuse, it is mainly just alcohol, weed and cocaine and I also occasionally use N20, psychedelics and random Chinese research chemicals. I don't think I'm really addicted to cocaine because I can and have recently gone quite a while without it and I don't crave it like I do alcohol, but it has almost come up quite a few times in therapy before biting my tongue. 

I also don't think that the cocaine is the cause of my insomnia because I have struggled with insomnia since I was 5 years old and have only been using cocaine for the last couple years. More likely, my insomnia is the result of an extremely violent childhood where I frequently thought, with good reason, that I would be killed in my sleep. 

Anyways, are these hallucinations enough for my therapist to think that I'm a danger to myself or others?

I'm a young woman. I made a post in another subreddit where I said I keep feeling uncomfortable in my body, ashamed of my body and self-conscious, no matter what weight I'm at. I feel almost ashamed when I'm near other women my age because I feel so unattractive. 

A few comments said I should go to therapy. But when I've been to therapy in the past, I've always felt much worse after each session than before. I kept feeling like ""this isn't what I need"", and felt like I was unneccessarily ""pathologising"" myself.

1ppf0w2,I feel lost in my own feelings,"Ive (20m) always struggled with mental health but never saught treatment due to my family who is very old fashioned, ive never told them how I feel but ive thought about not being here before, not so much anymore

As a general my mental health has improved greatly across the years between YouTubers I watch who break down psychology and offer tips and help, or programs I use to help or surrounding myself with good friends it improved

I dated my ex for over a year and ended that relationship 2 months ago, it was extremely toxic. I was immature at times and shut down while arguing, she would hit me and verbally and mentally abuse me, it took a long time but I finally got out, and I fell for my best friend (21f)

We've been friends for 3 years and idk what to do now its taking a toll on my psyche, we started hanging out after I broke up with my ex and missed hanging out with her, she started inviting me to hang out and we started spending multiple days a week together weeks on end. Shes genuinely amazing and we click on every level, Ive dated before but ive never wanted to date someone this bad. It could be spending time together in a vulnerable state but I want her 

I want her to the point it hurts my chest, I love being with her or around her, I feel like something is missing when im not with her, it feels like ive known her my whole life, she makes me laugh, and feel seen and loved on top of her being extremely caring and attractive.

I told her a few days ago how I feel and while she didnt outright say she didnt want to date me, she said she isn't looking for a relationship, I know this is true as she's told me that before we were talking even back when I was with my ex

But idk i feel unsatisfied? I also dont know how to react to the news... we agreed to keep hanging out as she deeply enjoys my company as do I with hers, and we were best friends before I told her how I felt anyways

I feel so torn, I want her so bad, ive never been more sure of anything in my life, not just for sex stuff I swear its not that, I feel like she truly understands me and is willing to see me when everyone else won't

I also dont wanna be a creep or make her uncomfortable, I dont want to pester her about my feelings but every day that passes that we aren't together hurts more and more, and the more time we spend together the worse it gets.

Its completely unreasonable to assume she'd break her peace to enter a relationship with me but idk, it truly hurts my soul not being with her and its starting to take a toll on my mental health, ive been anxious all the time and overthinking everything, barley sleeping and its horrible timing cus I just started a new job

1ppest8,My friend backhanded complimented me and is mad I’m upset?,"They said :do you ever wonder how I find you so attractive but for other people you’re average ?

I was like you just complimented me but subtracted it by saying the average part. 

This person knows I wasn’t considered pretty in my younger days into majority of my few years of adulthood I’ve lived and didn’t get much romantic or friendship through life. 

I have the same facial features but my body has blossomed a lot. I’m still insecure about my face and am considering getting surgery on one of my facial features. 

So being compared to others is very much a sore spot for me. So I feel what they said was wrong and nobody should ever say that to anybody. 

They said: I just complimented you , you’re focusing on the negative you always do that. You’re on the edge where one little criticism can push you off of it. 

And that I need to really fix my mindset in therapy.

I am in therapy and have been for multiple years. I’ve done DBT , CBT and talk therapy. Currently I have a skills focused therapy and a talk therapy.  

I do agree i should be more secure after how much therapy I’ve already done but I have made a lot of progress at the same time. I do agree that things do overwhelm me more than they should / do for most people.

Am I in the right and this person triggered me and then gaslit me (sorry couldn’t think of a better term) ?

Am I overreacting?

Or is it some mixture of both sides?

1ppe0iv,How to start therapy for problems you're almost too ashamed to even speak about?,"I’ve been looking into therapists in my area after finding the public insurance options pretty inadequate. My main problem right now is dealing with events in my late childhood that are still affecting me. I don’t have a great relationship with my mom, and when I was a kid she used a lot of social justice and feminist type of rhetoric to justify emotionally abusing me. I’m an early-twenties politically left-leaning man living in a very progressive place, and so working through these experiences among friends and romantic relationships has been very complicated for all the reasons you can imagine. I’ve found that when I begin to trust someone enough to tell them about the kinds of issues that I had with my mom, or that I have sexual trauma relating to an experience with a trans person, the people who care about me don’t want to disbelieve me outright, but the fact that I’ve shared these experiences sometimes plants a kind of latent skepticism toward me in their head which leads them to project opinions onto me I don’t have, which of course gradually erodes the relationship. This was the direct cause of me losing at least one female friend, and I’m pretty sure it also contributed partially to my last girlfriend leaving.

I know that these issues and how they relate to my self-loathing, sexual repression and self-harm are the main things I need to talk with a therapist, preferably a female therapist about, but it’s been so thoroughly ingrained in me that every woman I think I can trust will be skeptical before she’s sympathetic, will believe that my version of events *must* be dishonest or characterized by some secret right-wing agenda, and will attribute the trauma symptoms to manipulation rather than real hurt. I know that being flexible to other people’s experiences with certain kinds of language is one of the basic things therapists are trained for, nevertheless even the thought of repeating any of the things I’m saying here anonymously in a therapist office makes me feel embarassed and ashamed almost to the point of nausea. I went to the hospital a few months ago because I was having suicidal thoughts, and the whole time all I could think was “these nurses are only pretending to be sympathetic, everyone else here has much bigger problems”. I genuinely feel like being born male makes me morally tainted and undeserving of sympathy in a fundamental way, and I want to actually overcome these feelings instead of just being too embarrassed to even admit to myself or others that they exist at all.

I guess specifically what I’m curious about advice on is how a client is supposed to navigate bringing up topics that carry immense shame for them, and also I guess I’m curious if these anxieties are founded at all. In other words, do people often experience judgement or misinterpretation from therapists for talking about stuff like this? I know that these are common anxieties among gen z men so I’m sure somebody else has been through something like this. If I had reason to believe I was being judged or provoking hostility from the therapist it’d just be such a major setback that even the risk of it happening is making me reconsider the entire thing. I know everyone says it’s a very non-judgemental space but exceptions do exist and I have heard a couple of horror stories.

1pp5c9d,What is happening? What should I do?,"(Sorry it's long, take your time)

There’s this guy let’s call him D.
He was my very close friend, my first male best friend ever. I saw him as a brother.

There’s this girl P. She befriended him at the same time as I did. Thing is she has jealousy issues.

A few months ago, D proposed to me. I didn’t think much of it because I thought I’d come off as self-centred. Also because he had broken up with one of my friends at that time and caused huge trouble. I tried separating from him, but he always insisted on keeping the friendship alive.

But when I got to know that he didn’t see me as a sister anymore and is now confessing to me, I couldn’t take it. I told him, sorry, I always saw you as a brother.

I never had the guts to talk to him again. It made me a bit uncomfortable. He did try reaching out, but I apologized and said how I felt.

Now P got full attention from D and stopped talking to me.

When D had broken up with one of my friends, he’d talk shit, spread rumours about her everywhere he could. Now I know he does it about me too. He’s out there spreading lies about a bitchy version of myself that doesn’t exist.

This makes me very anxious to think of, because I know what bad things he can say about someone he doesn't like. Because of what impression will be spread about me. What if it reflects how my family raised me? To me, my family is very important.

I never see my grandma anymore since a few years back, she decided to move there. I also don’t have the best relationship with my parents and it just doesn’t seem to improve.

And lately, I haven’t been as happy with my boyfriend of over 3 years. I love him but I feel as if we’re growing apart. We’re both in our early twenties and seem to want completely different things. I’ve talked about the urge to move away and be with my grandma & he has stated several times he will not move away. He has a great job here and all his family and friends. Meanwhile, I have a horrible job and no friends. We’ve been arguing a little bit which is unlike us and I also have been getting into some… we will say “disagreements” with his family over the past few months and it’s been taking a toll on me as I always have got along with his family but his grandma made me cry, his father is friends with MY abusive ex, his mom and I got into an argument recently which is sad because I’ve always got along the best with her but she made me feel awful. I’m just not as happy as I used to be.

I’ve just realized I’m not happy in the current position I’m in. I’m unsure what to do since I do love my boyfriend, we’ve even talked about marriage. I’m also pretty dependent on my parents even at my age, especially with finances as again, I have a horrible job (I can’t tell you the amount of jobs I’ve applied to this year, the job market is horrible).

1pp6lvz,Has anyone managed to get out of a long period of anxiety using only online therapy?,"For about 6 years I have been living with this kind of background anxiety that never really goes away. I am not talking about two or three rough months, it is more like a way of living at this point. Some days are okay, then a few evenings in a row my heart starts racing for no reason, there is a lump in my throat, thoughts that I am going to mess everything up at work, that something bad will happen to my family, that I will lose it in the middle of a meeting.

I have tried two rounds of in person therapy with different therapists. The first lasted around 8 months, the second about 5. I showed up consistently once a week, did the exercises, journaling, the whole package. It helped a bit, but that daily restlessness, the tight stomach in the morning, stayed. Many times I walked out of the office more drained than when I went in, and then I would just drop the exercises.

Now I work full time and easily lose an hour just going back and forth to any office, so I started looking more seriously at online therapy. I came across Manhattan Mental Health Counseling when I was searching for something in the New York area that does telehealth and takes insurance, I read a bit of the therapists’ descriptions, it all looks pretty decent on paper, but I have no idea how it is in reality.

I filled out their contact form and had a short email exchange about matching and insurance, but I basically froze right before saying ok let us start. It is not really fear of video sessions, it is more that fear of getting into another long process, spending time and money and a year from now still being in pretty much the same place, just with a few more stories I have repeated ten times.

1pp56ob,"My life ,I guess what doesn’t break you breaks your soul","I’m 25 years old. I’ve felt emotionally different and detached for as long as I can remember. Even as a child, I felt older than my age not because I was trying to be mature, but because my mind was always alert, thinking about safety, control, status, money, and power while other kids were carefree. I didn’t feel like I belonged anywhere.

Early Childhood & Family Environment

My home environment growing up was unstable and emotionally intense. My parents fought frequently. My mother yelled a lot and hit me often though I get it cuz of what happened to her especially around academics. While physical discipline is culturally common, the level and intensity made me feel constantly on edge. Eventually I became emotionally numb to it at one point telling her to “go ahead and hit me,” which is when she stopped.

When I was around 6, my mother lost both her parents,who I was especially connected to apparently I used to sit in front of their photos and cry all the time Around the same time, my father was financially betrayed by a close friend and became depressed and withdrawn. My mother had to take on the role of sole emotional and practical provider working, managing the household, caring for me and my younger brother. I intellectually understand why she changed, but as a child I only experienced fear, yelling, and instability.

Our family was socially isolated. I didn’t have much interaction with other families, and among peers I felt weird, and misunderstood cuz they would look at me like a bully just cuz I was a little rough and moody I was often excluded . I learned early that the world wasn’t safe and that I had to be hyper-aware.

Early Psychological Patterns

From a very young age (around 9–10), I experienced early sexual thoughts and curiosity. I now recognize this as confusing and shame-inducing, but at the time I had no guidance or emotional safety. Over time this developed into compulsive behaviors (porn, masturbation), which later extended into substance use (smoking, alcohol, drugs).

I developed patterns of lying, manipulation, bullying, and acting out. I’ve hurt people. I’ve disrespected my parents. I feel deep guilt about this. I don’t see these actions as justified, but I now recognize they came from fear, powerlessness, and emotional overload rather than malice.

Adolescence

By age 13–14, I had persistent passive thoughts of death  not active suicidal intent, but a feeling that life was already “enough,” that I’d seen enough, that existence felt long and dull. These thoughts were accompanied by fear of hurting my parents and losing my family, which stopped me from acting on them. The thoughts have remained passive but consistent throughout my life.

I never felt innocent or carefree. I felt constantly alert, tense, and emotionally isolated. I didn’t experience joy the way others seemed to. I also felt an ongoing sense of being watched or targeted  not in a psychotic way, but as a deep belief that something bad was always coming.

Major Trauma & Loss

In early adulthood, my father passed away while my family was abroad and I was not present. Later, my younger brother died in a car accident in which I was driving. I carry intense guilt related to this event. My grandparents who I loved so much passed when I was kid that too cuz of me when my grandfather went to arrange a party for my birthday he had a heart attack and my grand mom soon after due to cancer and mental stress ,I lost my other grandfather too and my uncle andThese losses deeply destabilized me and reinforced my belief that life repeatedly targets me and those I love and I’m a Hindu so the rituals are intense and take a toll on the mind and what haunts me the most is all these people where incredibly kind and loving people not only me to everyone and I was like a curse to them and that’s what  i gave in return 

I have also undergone  5 surgeries (knees, shoulder, wrist)  and ruined my plans of being a footballer .live with chronic physical pain, obesity, and health issues worsened by substance use. My body feels damaged and unreliable, which feeds into my mental state.",2,1,2025-12-18 00:41:34,EnvironmentOne8679,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pp56ob/my_life_i_guess_what_doesnt_break_you_breaks_your/,therapy,0.75,Advice Wanted,-0.9979,0.07317460317460318,-0.7752160429954529,-1,-0.6723431008628058,-1

1ppa9td,I Think I Need To Change.,"Im making it a habit to continue talking about my situation just so I can get other people's persepective about myself.

To summarize my life right now, I have no friends, don't go anywhere, and can't be bothered to think about anything but ""right now"". Hygiene has taken a dive but nothing serious. I haven't had many negative thoughts since I usually find some screen to distract me from them. Lately though, I felt the need to stop whatever this whole situation is. 

I've probably been the most content i've been in years. Nothing bothers me, im under no pressure, and I have but one problem about spending my life like this. 

I know that this can't be sustainable yet I dont see a future where I do anything else. Being alone for so long means I have an active imagination so when I do really try to think about what I could be, all I see is myself lying limp in some alleyway. Completely broken and mindless, apparently too weak to handle life. 

This bothers me but its easy to not think about it. I dont want to.

Still, some part of me desperately needs help. Though I doubt I'd change even with other's input I'd like to at least have my curiousity satisfied by hearing what people think. 

I dont mind answering questions.

1pp8djj,Should I report a counsellor?,"I would value **professional perspectives** on the following situation involving a counsellor and whether the counsellor has broken professional boundaries?

**I AM NOT** \- looking for advice on the relationship itself (please dont comment ""girl just leave him etc"" all that is being dealt with separately.  

My post is literally around whether a) the counsellor has broken any rules pathologising my trauma without meeting me rather than guiding my husband to understand the impact of his behaviour on others and b) telling a sex addict that using prostitutes is fine if he is single, because hes not hurting anyone.  Ignoring the moral and ethics of prostitute use along with encouraging a sex addict.  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Background and relationship context**

* Early 2000s: I met my husband.
* Throughout the relationship he frequently stared at women and was openly flirtatious. I did not challenge this at the time.
* He later disclosed a long standing history of compulsive pornography use beginning in adolescence.

**Family life and division of labour**

* Mid 2000s: We had our first child.
   * He was disengaged during the pregnancy and stated that pregnancy and childcare were women’s responsibility.
   * I had little practical or emotional support and lived far from family with no peer support.
* I worked full time and earned more than him.
* Responsibility for childcare, household management and emotional labour rested almost entirely with me.
* Approximately 2 years later we had a second child.
   * I continued working full time while managing two children and the household with minimal support.
   * When travelling or managing logistics I was responsible for myself and both children while he managed only himself.

**Health difficulties**

* Around 10 years into the relationship, in my early 40s, I developed chronic health problems.
   * Symptoms included profound exhaustion and widespread pain.
   * I was repeatedly told it might be fibromyalgia and prescribed pain medication.
* Over several years my condition worsened.
   * I was unable to exercise without significant pain.
   * I gained approximately three stone.
   * I continued working full time and managing family responsibilities.
* Eventually an MRI revealed:
   * A significantly enlarged uterus due to fibroids, including one very large fibroid.
   * Adenomyosis invading the uterine muscle.
* The recommended treatment was a full hysterectomy.
* I was placed on an NHS waiting list of approximately three years.
* During this period I experienced increasing pain and fatigue with no reduction in expectations at home.

**Marital dynamics during illness**

* During my illness my husband became increasingly hostile.
   * He criticised me for not socialising, not having friends and not being pleasant towards him.
   * He stated he was incapable of love and not interested in sex.
   * He sent me articles about couples who were content without sex.
* I experienced significant isolation, loneliness and ongoing physical pain.

**Disclosure of sexual behaviour**

* September 2022: My husband disclosed that he had:
   * Regularly visited prostitutes over many years.  
   * Created pornographic material with multiple women. Scores of them. 
   * Maintained an extensive archive of pornographic material he had produced with him in them.
* Further discoveries included:
   * Emails, images and multiple fake identities spanning nearly a decade.
   * Sexual activity even occurring during family holidays.
   * Explicit images taken of himself in public spaces, including local woods, and an incident abroad where police were involved.
   * He later admitted he told police it was a consensual sexual game involving me, without my knowledge.
* The material involved women of varied ages and backgrounds. One as young as 19.
* He disclosed a history of compulsive sexual behaviour from adolescence.
* He admitted to unprotected oral sex with prostitutes and contracted sexually transmitted infections.
* Significant family finances had been spent.
   * I later had to take out a loan of approximately £130,000 to cover his debts or risk losing the house.

**After disclosure**

* I experienced significant trauma related to betrayal, health, finances and prolonged caregiving.
* He began attending Sex Addicts Anonymous.
   * He stopped pornography use and reported working towards sobriety.
* During this period I remained unwell and was still awaiting surgery.

**Medical treatment and counselling**

* This year I finally underwent a hysterectomy and spent approximately three months recovering.
   * Recovery involved physical healing and significant hormonal changes which left me emotional.
* During my recovery my husband began seeing a new counsellor (his 5th at this point).
* Following this:
   * He stopped attending SAA.
   * He believed that using prostitutes was acceptable if single.
   * He reported that the counsellor told him I had a personality disorder.
   * He shared that the counsellor provided him with information about personality disorders and suggested this explanation for my emotional state.

**Current concerns**

* I have never met or been assessed by this counsellor.
* My emotional responses relate to:
   * Prolonged medical trauma.
   * Betrayal trauma.
   * Chronic exhaustion and hormonal disruption following hysterectomy.
* I am concerned that trauma responses have been pathologised as a personality disorder without assessment (I have seen an email from the counsellor with this information)
* I am also concerned about the apparent shift from supporting sobriety to normalising prostitution use.  I overheard a zoom call where the counsellor said something along the lines of him not understanding what my issue is if my husband was single.  
* I am seeking professional views on:
   * Ethical issues around diagnosing or labelling a third party without assessment.
   * The distinction between trauma responses and personality disorder diagnoses.
   * Whether this behaviour raises concerns warranting a complaint to a regulatory body.

1pp5gt1,EAP counselor double booked a virtual appointment over my in-person and told me to leave when I showed at at the scheduled time. Another counselor declined my request for appointment for no reason. Is this normal practice?,"A couple of months ago I tried to see a counselor using my employer's EAP program. They matched me with a therapist. I called and scheduled an in-person appointment. A little later she reached out and asked to change the time slot because while she was talking to me on the phone someone has booked that time slot online. Ok, no biggie, I agreed to the new time she proposed. I drove to the appointment. Walked in, sat down, she looked at her computer and asked me if I was another person. I said no, I am me. She said she has another virtual appointment scheduled and she's so sorry, we will need to reschedule. I was taken aback but okay, what can I do. She put me down for another day. I left feeling irritated and disappointed. I wasted time driving to and from her location. The next day she was reaching out AGAIN trying to reschedule because a virtual client booked the slot I was in. At that point I told her to just forget about it and cancel the appointment. 

Is this normal behavior? A counselor that keeps rescheduling and giving preference to virtual appointments? I didn't want a virtual appointment, I specifically sought out someone to see in-person. I felt so let down and disappointed by the whole experience. 

After a few weeks I tried again. This time I picked another counselor myself through the EAP website and sent a request for an appointment. A couple of days later I received a response - the counselor declined my request. I requested first available time, so it's not like there was a scheduling issue. No explanation whatsoever. What does this mean? Why would they just decline my request without providing a reason? I am really discouraged now.

I don’t think I will bring it up today but honestly it feels like the worst addiction I have. I’ve brought up drinking, stimulant abuse, weed, and a lot of emotional stuff but I feel like a lot of my addictions (particularly to alcohol) start to spiral from the guilt of porn addiction. I chose a male therapist because I thought it’d be easier but now I am not so sure. I was going to have a bit to drink before going maybe to loosen myself up but I don’t think that’s effective when I am trying to stop drinking too and he mentioned their policy is to ask patients not to be high/drunk during sessions at least. Should I hint at it or something? If someone could maybe give me a way to mention it without saying it outright that’d be helpful. I feel uncomfortable even saying the word porn 😭.

Also I am not even someone who would’ve gone to therapy in the first place, my parents forced me to. But I would say it has helped me more than I thought. One thing the therapist mentioned is that I seem to care a lot about what people think of me and fear being examined which is true, but that kinda is holding me back from mentioning it still ig.

1pp3nil,"If antidepressants masks your symptoms too well, can that make therapy less beneficial?","My partner is on antidepressants and is going to talk-therapy sessions, but has expressed that she wants to quit her meds. She says they make her feel so happy and content that when she's in session she feels like there are no problems to talk about, and without meds her life becomes really hard, giving her things to work on in therapy. She wants to go without them so she can work through her mental problems more directly. 

I respect that she wants to confront her issues more directly. But without her meds, she has very little control over her emotions and spirals out often. Quitting them would be a dangerous idea in my opinion.

I managed to persuade her to keep taking them, thankfully. But it makes me wonder what the solution is for her. Asking her doctor about a lower dose? A different form of therapy?

1poxedl,i feel that i am abused in therapy what should i do?,I been with psychiatrist for 2 years now. Now i have new job for month and half now and i am busy and i feel stable so i now see her twice or once a week. But she always demands to see me once a week. But now i feel more dependable on myself and stable and i want to explore that. When ever i have problem with my meds and text her for advice she tells me to book an appointment to discuss this. Along past month she always question why i am not consistent with my therapy sessions and sometimes texts me. i feel that the dynamic of the therapy relationship is toxic and all what she cares about is money. I once told her i want to taper down my meds she literally told me that’s the first thing patient says when he or she is relapsing. And agreed to taper down my meds after long talk. I am with this psychiatrist because i heard she makes DBT sessions and along the two years she never talked about any DBT expect one time. Now i am with another therapist online and i am noticing progress and she uses DBT techniques with me and i am feeling better. Now my family also suggest to see another psychiatrist to track my meds with me and stop going to her. Should i ghost her or explain i am not comfortable.

1pp2u0i,I swear I dont understand people anymore,"Its my frist time venting to strangers I stopped doing that ago for years to everyone not 
Because of the usual reasons of being judged  , etc. Bevayse i knew i always have high expectations and somethings wrong with me and that even if by some chance someone does get me they won't get how everything every single subject is connected to each  other backgorund , context etc so when i ddi manage to share i went into space bevayse i didnt do it bcs of venting but to be understood when I knew I could neevr be and was never and that i always ended up being furstared with myself becayse depsite all the efforts nobody gets i have to put into explaining even a single asked question like
What subject are u taking etc . Bcs the way i think is just. I cant bear not telling the entire cosmo in my mind cuz things affect things and it goes on then I stop and say not worth the effort and the cycle repeats till this year and like here we go again 

Yeah. 




I swear how easy is for people to downgrade even just a small text of a summary of such an emotionally challenging experiance just so u can appeal to others and not sound dramatic, victim etc and YET STILL IAM THE problem.
Wow I might be the problem but does that person know what others do to me? Or how much i try to change or fine i do have a long problem of emotionally and textingly investing to people. So just when I deleted all discord insta (way long and believe me complicated ) 
And just went for reddit JUST FOR a game and I made a post like any other person looking for friends , just told a bit about mt friends experiance which ill attach below cuz iam honestly tired of trying to explain to anybody whenever anybody asks me whats wrong specifically or any adult because no one seems to understand me
So know I have these bad habits of not sharing anything to anyone , not making effort and self isolating and yet when I accidently try to give myself a chance and come online to text 
I am labeled as the problem


And I also fail because maybe a person like that person would have learned early on that nobody cares or is just a mature person,  cuz isnt that what a mature person is ? 
Just here for the trashy brain rotten things and no deep or honest stuff or something that belongs  to a person's own experiance .
And if by any chance somethings one sentence long it just freaks people out and like lowers any processing ability they have .

Like how much more do I change what do I even do .
If I talk about it like a normal person over a small thing iam dramatic . If i dont iam numb to myself but isolated and labeled as why u always sad by others then emotional if I be me.
Like the hell do i do ? 
(THE story of my life.) 

Maybe the problem isnt that i am being dramatic over  a single sentence knowing that person knows nothing about me and even if I were to crash out which I have stopped doing ago years ago and has lead to my numbness , 
Maybe it's about how I got triggered and despite always being isolated and not caring and have accoeted that maybe it isnt me.
Is it me ? In this exact moment i feel sad broken and never liked and i just wanted one thing in my life good friends but after every attempt all it ends up is 
Iam the problem and like iam to emotional sensitive text too much or I cant find a word from dictionary other then poetry and iam too much , complicated by my parents etc then 
Iam still blamed when I have stopped talking and remain islolated to a degree to appeal to people who dont give a crash about  being yourself for a second cuz maybe being yourself isnt saying what u feel or mean and maybe being mature is no long talk to complicated no feeling then ur fine.

Iam so sick I cannot even tell the entire year from every past friend experiance I have been having recurring nightmares which are normal dreams about them appearing to my dreams and it's a nightmare because after all time , I still remain in every stage of my life while everyone has moved on. 

I try so hard i did try to be likable to be myself to change to care i do
But I feel so lonely 
And I have stopped expecting in the way or that ideal idea of "" friends group "" 
I have lost myself 
And yet still it seems god hates me
But then I remember 
Why would be listen to me among the 8 billion people when half of them are dying literally bcs of war , isnt that acctuslly serious so if hes cannot listen to them and life is the epitome of u won't get anything u want or this is jua tlife then why do i begg


Every stage new story new imorovmemt and this year was the laat straw afrer they gave away my best friend my cat last year. And i am ultimately left with nothing when i mean nothing lost all of it one by one things , people , the game invested in , online accounts everything one by one , my passions eveything and yet still iam alive and I try explaining things to whoever asks for feelings nobody gets it 
The ones who even try asking dont get it and the ones to whom I just say for context 
Iam labeled as like a pathethic peive of shit 


I will probs delete this after a while because of my stupid habbit of feeling suddenly exposed and avoident nature now cuz ill feel to exposed 
And copy oaste
In my notes that maybe 
Someone hopefullt retives my other bunch of notes even on daily stuff because apparently iam not allowed to express when i die



( therapy is useless even though i dont wanna tell ""her: and my parents cuz cmon now iam the lucky one getting myself help that people would want .
But like iam so tired of suppressing my true self i just have to pretend everyday at school at home everyday even with rhe expressing i do that's just there for the 
"" after it's done I go and have a cry bcs I just expressed to much or it broke. My cover or I just go numb ) 


( I dont know what to do when this is just one thing I explained one experience regarding 1 catigory 
I dont even know what to do about my clinical depression even during those past extrovert trying to fit within friends etc , emotional investment era. ) 

I just maybe i wrote this because it's. A therpahy group and maybe people here at least won't roll there eyes at me. Or I ll find anybody who feels the same. 

Also thanks I guess to anybody who took the time to at least read this.

Sometimes I feel all of us might be so lonely but on the outside everybody would act all buisness and all that matters is working working and this shitty earth system. Like robots.

1poziqt,Can sex therapy help?,"Hey guys,

(40/male) I am interested in exploring the use of therapy to help me function better in sexual relationships. 

Over time, I have developed some fixations/fetishes involving things like femdom, cuckolding, humiliation, and other similar things. 

Now, to be clear, the problem is not that I am uncomfortable or ashamed or anything like that. The issue is that it causes functional impairment in regular/vanilla relationships. But the point is, I don’t need advice about accepting myself or anything like that. I need to solve a problem here. 

It’s gotten to the point where I can have real performance problems in ‘normal’ sexual situations, and it severely impacts my ability to enjoy sex and to approach new relationships with women. 

During sex, I literally have to run through elaborate fantasies to get and stay aroused and to reach orgasm. Often, I have trouble reaching orgasm with a partner. I end up living in my head and not being in the moment. It also causes a feedback loop of anxiety and further decreased performance. 

Is there a way to go to sex therapy and “de-program” from all this crap and just learn to enjoy regular, vanilla sex again? I just want to be able to have normal, functional sex with female partners and not have it be a struggle.

Thanks for any advice.

1porilq,what is wrong with me :(,"Today I made a small mistake by cutting a granola packet incorrectly, and it upset my dad. He expressed concern about why I struggle with simple tasks and described me as disorganized. While I didn’t want to use my mental health as an excuse, I explained that I wasn’t feeling like myself today. The situation escalated to the point where he lost his appetite and raised concerns about how this behaviour might affect me in the workplace, as well as his reputation and connections. This made me reflect deeply on my past mistakes. I am genuinely trying to understand what’s going on with me and to improve myself.

2024 was an extremely difficult year for me academically, financially, and emotionally. Things became so overwhelming that I was admitted to a psychiatric ward following a suicide attempt, and I had to take a year off university to focus on healing and rebuilding my life. During this time, I was struggling with severe mental health challenges and unhealthy emotional attachments, which I am still actively working through in therapy.

On the academic and financial side, I was funded by a government bursary but lost it because my family’s income was slightly above the threshold. As my mental health deteriorated, I struggled to focus, missed assignments, and performed poorly. I was experiencing persistent suicidal ideation and was later diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. I am now in the process of transferring to another institution, which requires going through a readmission process. Recently, being rejected by my dream university triggered a lot of anger and disappointment within my family. This was followed by unrelated issues being brought up, such as failing my driver’s licence test twice, which they paid for. Additionally, my entire family—including my younger sister—was upset with me for losing my mom’s phone, even though it was replaced. When I tried to express my emotions and cried, I was told I was being dramatic and that, at 21, I should be “strong enough to handle things.”

I have taken responsibility for my actions and apologised where necessary. Regarding the phone incident, I wasn’t fully aware of my surroundings at the time—I stepped out of the car to buy groceries and my attention was fixated on that. I am actively working on bettering myself every day, and I acknowledge
 that I will make mistakes again. The issue is not a lack of accountability—I have taken it. However, continuing to shame and repeatedly punish me for past mistakes does not help me heal, grow, or move forward. While my family has the right to feel upset, constant criticism only makes recovery and self-improvement more difficult.",3,2,2025-12-17 14:05:10,forestviolette,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1porilq/what_is_wrong_with_me/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,-0.9978,-0.07484030197444833,-0.8522618412971497,-1,-0.7404389810434645,-1

1pogrhh,Is it normal to ask this to minors?,"I’m back at my parents house for the holidays and it brought up a memory I hadn’t thought about for years. I was in therapy when I was 15, which my dad was reluctant to do in the first place so the compromise was that he got to choose my therapist. She was a part of a christian group of therapists but an LMFT nonetheless. My dad went through my phone and found that I had been listening lesbian erotica audios (eek sorry) and he ended up emailing this information to my therapist who brought it up during our next session. The sessions were with only me and her and I was so flustered that she knew this information and brought it up (my dad didn’t tell me that he told her what he found). 

We started talking about it and I remember her asking me if I usually masturbate to these audios and when I struggled to answer (because I was so shocked) she kept pushing until I told her what I do when listening to these audios and how often I do this. We moved on and talked about more general things for the rest of the session but still, rough!

At the time I didn’t think anything of it but now, 6 years later I am wondering if that’s even okay to ask a minor during a private therapy session. Seems odd but idk it def could be part of the job.

1pojt0c,What even is a midlife crisis?,"Hello there. I've never done anything like this before but I am in need of some honest advice and/or help. I've been traveling for work for a better part of three months now. I usually get to sleep in my own bed 1 night a week, sometimes two if im lucky. All other nights have been spent alone in a hotel of some sort. What happens to someone when they have that kind of free time or change in their routine. Well im going to tell you.

A bit of my background I have been married out of wedlock for 20 years. We stayed together to make it work and give our kids (yes it turned into 2 children) a better domestic life than we had. The wife and I are civil to each but never really had any commonalities (besides having kids) to build any kind of real relationship from. My kids are certified adults now and pretty much are exploring starting their own worlds.

I may jump around a bit please bare with me. All these tidbits come together in the end.

I used to do what I dreamed of doing which was play music and travel the world. Everything was going good with that until I got sick and was diagnosed with kidney disease in my 20s. This would lead to the slow decline of my health until I needed a transplant to continue living a relatively free life. My wife was the one who was able to donate her kidney to save my life, something that hospitals don't particularly recommend. Everything goes well with the surgery and post recovery for both of us.

Fast forward to now, ten plus years later. Being alone in a hotel can make you realize things real quick. One thing that came particularly clear is I don't miss my wife when I'm gone. I've had the conversation with my wife that when the kids graduated high-school we should think about getting divorced. Well when you are stuck in a comfortable routine there really isn't much need to make drastic decisions. 

Loneliness can creep up on a person really fast when traveling by yourself. What did I decide to do? Well, I found someone on Reddit to talk to and help pass the time. This person happened to live on the other side of the world. She had enough of a personality to rope me in and tell me everything a man like me wants to hear. This reminds me what it is like to feel a deep connection to someone that I haven't felt in a long time. 

While that is all going on and my traveling back and forth from home is still ongoing (to this day) I received some upsetting news. The band that I used to play for, and recently rejoined but my work life moderated that involvement, announced a pretty extensive North American tour but I was not invited or even told about. I tried contacting them and begging them to reconsider, but was only told that they figured I was busy living my life and wasn't an option this time. 

This all sent me into a downward spiral that I was already leaning towards. I make more money than I have ever made in my life and I am absolutely miserable. I feel life is slipping through my fingers and I will just be another what if tragedy. My wife and I own a house and land that, if sold, would put us ahead even separately. She has a well paying job that any selfish decisions of mine wouldn't financially hurt her. 

I want to quit my job, live a minimalist life and play music until I can't physically anymore. I want to make drastic changes to my life for the first time in 20 plus years. Am I losing my mind? Is this a phase? I don't want it to be phase, I want to change what isn't working in my life.

I need advice and I needed to get this off my chest.",10,12,2025-12-17 07:03:01,Historical-Buy8953,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pojt0c/what_even_is_a_midlife_crisis/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,0.9954,0.14032931354359926,0.0,1,0.32668586270871985,1
1povnyh,Question for people currently in therapy: what happens between sessions?,"Hi everyone — I’m trying to better understand the lived experience of being in therapy, specifically what happens between sessions. This is not a product, app, or research study — I’m just looking to learn from people who are willing to share their experience.

If you’re comfortable, I’d really appreciate your thoughts on any of the questions below. You can answer as many or as few as you like.

Questions:
	1.	When something emotionally intense or important happens between sessions, what do you usually do in that moment?
	2.	Have you ever had an insight, realization, or strong feeling during the week that felt important — but was hard to remember or explain once your session came around?
	3.	How do you usually prepare for therapy sessions, if at all?
(Notes, journaling, thinking it through, nothing, etc.)
	4.	Do you ever feel like the beginning of sessions is spent trying to reconstruct what happened rather than getting into it?
	5.	Is there anything you wish you could bring into therapy more clearly, but struggle to put into words?
	6.	In your experience, when do the hardest moments tend to show up — during sessions, or outside of them?

There’s no right or wrong answer — I’m mostly interested in patterns and shared experiences.

1podmsf,I'm really embarrassingly attached to my therapist,"Just, what the title says. I have been seeing my therapist for about a year or so. Today she helped me through a very big fear, but that also meant we drove there together. I'm young, I can't drive yet. 

That just made it even worse. I feel absolutely terrible about it, to be honest. I'm so aware that I don't know much about her and I have this idealised view of her, but then she tells me little bits about her life in which she seems less than perfect. Which makes me like her even more?

It's not a romantic feeling or anything. More like.. I would love to know her. She's only about 10 years older than me, which doesn't help. I don't always like her much after hard sessions, but sometimes I find myself laying in bed at night and just rethinking all these ways she's made me feel safe. 

And then even just the thought of never speaking to her again truly makes me panic. Even worse, the thought of her getting injured, sick, or dying. It genuinely makes me want to cry even just THINKING of it. 

All of this makes me feel pretty bad. She's just being nice to me because it is her job. She's doing these things for me because she is a kind person and she wants this job. It doesn't have anything to do with what I am to her, really. Like, I feel like such a creep honestly. I just wish I could stop caring so much. I wish she could be 'just a woman I talk to', but she's not.

1popzis,"I ghosted my therapist. 2 years later, I need to go back.","I have seen many different therapists/psychs/etc. many times since I was a young child. I was admitted to an inpatient treatment facility as a teenager. I was put on a variety of different SSRI and sleep meds as a kid (starting at 7/8 years old) that I feel were used to bandaid family trauma. Whatever way you look at it - I have not stuck with therapists and never had “official goodbyes.” 

I made the decision to go no contact with one of my parents after attending family counseling and seeing little change. The therapist that conducted the family counseling also was my personal therapist, and co-ran my group therapy. I saw her 3x a week for a period. I stopped seeing her once I went to college.

It has been 11 years since seeing this therapist/going no contact with parent. My other parent whom I am still in contact with (albeit strained) has since suffered from a TBI that left them paralyzed with short term memory issues and occasional emotional outbursts. These emotional outbursts are often directed toward/about the parent I am no contact with. 

I decided to go to therapy of my volition about 5 years ago. I knew I wanted to address the root of my mental health issues. It was hard, but I genuinely made improvements in many different aspects of my life. My “open wound” didn’t feel so open. This therapist definitely helped to get me to that spot. 

I initially brought up changing from 1x a week with this therapist to every other week sessions. They warned me against doing this. I am a people pleaser and gave in. Things in my life were calmer and there was less to talk about. It began to feel like a chore to go. I felt like I had a mask on during therapy sometimes - like I had to live up to this therapist’s idea of me. After seeing this therapist for 3 years, I had a semi distant family member pass away. I cancelled sessions to be with my family for the time. 

My therapist emailed me a time or two asking to reschedule - I never responded. We met over Telehealth so it was our only form of contact. Since then, the email I used has been locked/disabled due to inactivity. I felt I was as at peace as a person could be about being no contact, and didn’t really feel an urge to keep up therapy. I have felt guilt over this ever since (which, should I?) because my therapist put time into our relationship (I know, that’s what I paid for them to do lol).

My sibling still sees this no-contact parent. Recently, my sibling became engaged. The wedding is in mid 2026. My no contact parent will be invited to this wedding. I am part of the wedding party. Our paths will inevitably cross in some way. I have no desire to reconcile and to be honest don’t even want to acknowledge the parent. Fear I have not felt in a long time is creeping up on me.

I know I need to see a therapist before the wedding. I am going for my sibling. It is not their job to deal with the relationships within our family, specifically when it comes to the wedding. They are already very worried about both our parents being together in the same space. 

My husband thinks I should go back to my last therapist. This therapist I had as an adult experienced a lot of my recent family dynamic. I would not have to re-explain everything like with a brand new therapist. I am conflicted between this, going to the therapist I saw 3x a week as a teen, or attempting to find a new one.

Should I: A) Find a new therapist, B) See my therapist from adulthood, or C) See my therapist from adolescence?

Follow up: If you think I should choose B), how do I address the ghosting issue so we can just move on back to normal therapy sessions?

1popguf,Does healing really mean being “positive” all the time?,"When a lot of people first come into healing or therapy,  
they expect one thing:  
to become more “positive,” more light-filled,  
ideally without pain, without darkness.

But healing isn’t about making the darkness disappear.  
It’s about learning how to live with it.

Life has always been two-sided.

There is light — and there is shadow.  
There is love — and there is fear.  
There are beginnings — and there are endings.

If we only allow the light and reject the dark,  
we don’t become healed.  
We become incomplete.

Real healing is being able to notice growth even in pain,  
and to sense small traces of hope even at our lowest points.

When you can hold joy and grief at the same time,  
you stop being thrown around by your emotions.  
A deeper kind of steadiness starts to form.

Healing isn’t about erasing the dark.  
It’s about knowing that when the dark shows up,  
you’re still safe within yourself.

1poqxru,Need Advice,"
Help Needed as I am feeling remorseful!!

A long post but please read through this.

○Hii everyone! I really need your help to get out of this. I am a male and in my university, made a lot of friends but with some time and through circumstances I really got close to a particular friend as our interests and ideologies matched a lot. Slowly we become best friends too, we used tp had a lot of arguments as well over petty things but those arguments are not bitter and eventually lead us to know each other more. We have started spending almost more than half of day together. Eventually he become a family to me and I have started getting attached to him as he used to take care a lot of me and my feelings in the hostel.

○ But in our cultural fest, something bad happened and I had a fight with him and my other friends. Next day, I apologised for it to everyone but everyone become so anti against me after that and boycotted me. At this particular stage, I realised how much he meant to me and after 20 days he somehow came back to me and started talking to me and this time I know I can't live without him atleast at that place where everyone left me.
○ But things has changed between us, he is no longer the same person he was with me before and eventually I started getting depressed at that place feeling so lonely. In our industrial trip at goa, I realised that it's not just attachment and it's love because I can't imagine myself living without him. He matters to me more than myself ..I had a liking towards two girls before but this is the first time I actually felt how loving someone is. I tried getting away from him but he alwys get back to me. Eventually after getting so much tired of all these things, I attempted suicide but I got saved by other hostel mates. After that, I conveyed my feelings to him so that he doesn't think that whatever I have done is because of recent behavior of him towards me.  But, in the end he said I am a bad person and he hates me now and he even said that even If I died he wouldn't have cared. Anyways it's been two and half years and we haven't talked and graduated as well living in different cities.
○ Honestly, I feel so bad for him now that I have caused so much trouble for him and how would he had felt becuase of my feelings as he was a very big homophobic. Can someone please guide me how can I get out of this guilt that I caused so much problems for the perosn I called best friend.  He genuinely took care of me as a friend only and I am such a stupid that I got possessive for him. 
○I am blocked from everywhere btw but should I try to reach out to him and apologise for whatever happened. How can I come out of this guilt of loving my best friend that too of same gender. My life is already so miserable and I really dont want to carry this baggage any more. 

○Any help would be appreciated and please don't hate me for my identity and spread hateful comments regarding that. It took so much courage to post it here.

I just feel so worthless and stupid and I just feel like I have no one to even talk to I don’t even feel like I have a best friend I can go to. I mean maybe I’m in like a slightly toxic environment my mother is caring ofc but is a bit  negative and I just feel like whenever she talks to me it’s to lecture and I just feel like I don’t have a motherly mom and I just wonder if the rest of my life is gonna be like this constant feeling of sadness. But I also feel like I’m a bit dramatic at times bc when I’m around ppl I’m normal but just when I’m alone with my thoughts I kinda spiral like this but yea has anyone else felt like this sorry for long post ,2,2,2025-12-17 09:39:01,Subject_Nature_374,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pon00z/depression/,therapy,1.0,Vent / Rant,0.9731,-0.19416666666666665,-0.8313915729522705,-1,-0.16259911980946862,0
1poe1vh,Grief possibly being unfairly pathologiesed?,"TL;DR: lost a parent, leaned heavily on a partner, now being told my grief looks like a personality disorder. Feeling confused and shamed.

I lost a parent less than a year ago and started a relationship around the same time. We were friends first, and they were very supportive during the immediate aftermath. I leaned on them a lot, which we were both aware of.

This was my first experience of real grief and I have limited family support. I struggled emotionally and became very attached. Over time, the relationship got strained. My partner started to believe my emotional reactions were more than grief and suggested I might have a personality disorder, influenced by their past experiences.

My own therapist disagreed and felt it wasn’t appropriate to assess something like that so close to a major bereavement. We tried therapy together, but it often felt like the focus was on me regulating better, without much acknowledgment of how their withdrawal affected the dynamic.

They ended things recently and I then came across something they’d written online that framed me as emotionally unstable and the reason the relationship failed, without mentioning the grief or context. That’s been really painful.

I don’t blame them for feeling overwhelmed or needing space, but it hurts to feel like the worst year of my life is being used to define my whole personality, and to justify ending things. 

Has anyone else had their grief misunderstood or weaponised in a relationship? How did you make sense of it?

1pocfs2,I feel like I’m being misled.,"To start..my husband has an alcohol problem. It’s not everyday..it’s not even every month but when he drinks, he drinks too much and starts acting like a jerk. It’s not about him though. It’s about my therapist. 
After my husband’s last binge and subsequent argument, I had therapy the very next day and I was distraught because the fight got bad and there were talks of divorce.. Fast forward a few weeks, I’m seeing my therapist again for the first time since the big fight. Everything is healing in my marriage, my husband and I had a two hour talk and came to the conclusion that he shouldn’t drink anymore so I’m telling her all of this. She thinks that I am in the wrong for expressing my opinion to my husband about him drinking, she said I was the reason we fought and I expressed my opinion with the expectation that he wouldn’t drink and when he did anyway, I got angry (which I’m not denying) and that’s why we fought. She said I need to work on not expressing my opinion. That’s crazy to me because I feel like that will build resentment in me, to be uncomfortable…to be upset and not say anything. I told her that I want to still express my opinion in my own house and in my own marriage and that I would much rather work on not getting so upset when I express my opinion and it isn’t validated or respected whatever. She straight up told me no you can’t do that. She compared it to a snowball. I express my opinion, they don’t listen to “what I want them to do” and the snowball starts rolling, I get angry and the snowball gets bigger. I tried to tell her that it’s a snowball before I ever even open my mouth. 


There was a lot more.. but am I getting sound advice here? I’m really willing to hear all different opinions.

1ponoae,Does he care?,"My therapist’s office has become such a safe space for me, and I love my appointment with him every week. But I feel so uncomfortable because I can’t decide if he genuinely cares about me. I know there are professional boundaries, but does he care about me as a client? As a human? Or am I just an annoying little chore he has to attend to every week?

I already feel like everyone I meet dislikes me. So how can he like me? I’m needy, I’m awkward, I’m broken. I cry in EVERY SESSION. Sometimes I can barely look him in the eye. I repeat myself and have taken so long to make progress. It took me months of work to even believe that I have value—any sort of value. And even that belief is still shaky sometimes. If he wanted to hit me, I would let him.

I wish I could listen to his thoughts about me. Is he laughing about me behind the scenes? Does he think I’m pathetic? Do I vanish from his mind as soon as I leave? Sometimes I feel so stupid and naive for telling someone so much when I’m not even sure if they care.

Surely I’m just another file number to him. I doubt I’m the most compelling case he has. I bet I’m just run-of-the-mill. I hope with all my heart that he cares about me, but it seems so improbable; he’s so far above me. I bet if I died on a park bench tonight and never saw him again, he wouldn’t give it a passing thought. I was never worth it, anyway.",1,2,2025-12-17 10:15:03,sumo_mouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1ponoae/does_he_care/,therapy,1.0,Vent / Rant,0.737,-0.07195512820512817,-0.40203386545181274,1,0.005692041633067996,0

I can’t feel romantic love. Every time I talk to a girl I feel extreme guilt, like I know it will go no where cuz I can’t find that deeper connection with anyone. I’ll get a girls number just to ghost her later on because of a gut feeling it won’t work out, she’s not the one for me, or because I CANT ESTABLISH FEELINGS FOR HER. Rinse and repeat for the last two years. The last time I felt a true deep connection with a girl was 5 years ago, I’m 19 now.

1poj8ey,New to This.,"So, I (27, nb) come from a family that very firmly believed in the tough it out, therapy doesn’t work— you know, that whole deal. It’s really caused a lot of apprehension and anxiety on not just asking for help, but eventually taking the steps to seeking out therapy. After a very major event recently, my partner and friends have finally pushed me into seeking therapy for my long term issues on top of this, and I actually have the ability to maybe see a professional that’s really close to where I live and within network. 

However I feel really sick about it. I know I would benefit greatly, and I do genuinely want to take this step since if I don’t at this point I might be in a really bad situation if I don’t take the reigns of my mental health.

1poizu5,help! should i break up with my therapist?,"i’m a college student and started online/phone therapy a few months ago. i struggle with adhd as well as anxiety and depression so i thought it would be helpful for me. i’ve been trying to give it time to see if we click but there are a few things i’m really struggling with. i’ve never had another therapist so i don’t know if this is normal.

first, even though i’m pretty talkative, my therapy appointments are filled with long, awkward silences. the first few minutes are usually fine, and if i’ve had a busy week she can keep me talking for the most of the first half, but the rest of the time is so painful and it feels like both of us are desperately trying to come up with something to say. shouldn‘t i have something to say to her? shouldn’t she have something to say to me?

even when it’s not silent, it’s so uncomfortable in general. a lot of the time i feel like i am misleading her or she hasn’t really understood the situation, and i really don’t understand some of her suggestions. and maybe this this a me problem, but i feel so uncomfortable and have no idea what to say when she says “great job” or “i’m sorry that happened.”

i also just don’t really understand what i’m supposed to be getting out of it. i almost never feel better after i talk to her, and i don’t feel like i’ve really learned anything either.

maybe therapy just isn’t my thing. like i said, i haven’t had a different therapist, so i wouldn’t know. or, am i doing it wrong? a few times i tried to go in with a list of “grievances” from the week, but that didn‘t always work to fill the time, and sometimes i’d end up feeling worse about that stuff after i brought it up.

anyway, i’d love any advice about what i can do differently or if i should be switching therapists/ giving up etc.",1,1,2025-12-17 06:24:30,Specific-Award6284,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1poizu5/help_should_i_break_up_with_my_therapist/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,-0.9601,0.002857142857142855,0.0,1,-0.2874585714285714,-1
1poiwub,Is my therapist crossing boundaries?,"I’ve been seeing this current therapist for over a year now, and things have been okay, but I notice that I usually don’t leave sessions feeling great compared to other therapists I’ve previously had. However, her style is more ask questions to guide the convo, but she lets me talk mostly and come to my own conclusions.

However lately something that has been bothering me is I feel like sometimes she asks me questions that feel unnecessary for a therapist to know. And I sometimes wonder if it’s out of her own curiosity vs critical knowledge to know to support me as a client. 

I have talked about financial things like being in a little debt or figuring out bills or getting a raise at work and each time she flat out asks me what the dollar amount is. Each time I respond without giving an actual figure and other times i’ve had to say “I don’t feel comfortable sharing” or “why is this relevant.” 

I could understand for debt trying to make sure i’m not in a massive hole that could affect my mental health (I’m not) but when i’ve discussed my raise at work or that i had to hire a contractor for a critical reason, she flat out asked me “how much” each time. 

When I seem visibly uncomfortable, she’s asked “why does this make you uncomfortable” and i’ve responded “it just does.” But i feel like it feels odd to have to have a boundaries conversation with my own therapist? It just makes me feel like I want some things to keep my own and that I didn’t enter this therapist-client relationship as an entitlement to all my personal info (like finances). 

I wanted the community’s thoughts if they think this is normal in therapy or if she’s crossing some boundaries? Any advice?

1pocrsu,How do I know when therapy isn’t working anymore vs. when I’m just avoiding doing the work?,"I’ve been in therapy consistently for a while almost 2 years. I’m very self-aware, very reflective, and I can explain my patterns in detail — avoidance, shame, people-pleasing, impulsive spending, procrastination, fear of responsibility, etc.

The problem is: despite all this insight, my actual behavior hasn’t changed much.

I still:

•    avoid things until pressure forces me to act

•    procrastinate and half-ass important goals

•    use spending as emotional regulation

•    freeze when I feel shame instead of pushing through

•    rely on other people financially and emotionally more than I want to



I often leave therapy feeling understood and soothed, but then I repeat the same patterns. Lately I’ve realized that insight and validation aren’t translating into discipline, structure, or real change.

My therapist is kind, supportive, and reflective. She often tells me I’m “where I’m supposed to be” and that growth takes time. Part of me believes that. Another part of me worries that therapy has turned into a place where I process feelings instead of actually learning how to do hard things consistently.

So I’m stuck between two fears:

1.    I leave therapy prematurely and miss something important

2.    I stay in a style of therapy that makes me feel better but doesn’t push me to change

For people who’ve been in therapy long-term:

•    How did you know when a therapist or modality wasn’t the right fit anymore?

•    Did switching to something more skills-based (CBT, DBT, coaching, etc.) actually help?

•    How do you tell the difference between therapy “not working” and you avoiding discomfort?



I’m not trying to blame my therapist — I’m trying to take responsibility and make sure I’m not outsourcing growth to insight alone.

1pocooq,BEWARE OF TALKSPACE,"Now that I've been wronged by talkspace, I've been doing some digging and seen a few other posts from others experiencing issues as well. So making another post so people can be aware. 

I used talkspace in 2022 for four months. Almost FOUR YEARS later, they sent me a string of emails a week ago that I owe for services from 2022 that were never paid. They're asking me to pay for seven sessions worth of services with a deadline in January, after which apparently there will be late fees. 

At this point, it's been so long that I don't know if those services even took place, and I've been going through the hassle of contacting my insurance company and my banks to look for evidence. I've had a ticket open for a week pleading for help, even a payment plan or reduction of fees, or evidence that those sessions were attended. Anything. The AI chat bot responses I get provide no help and don't answer my questions. In anyone's post about this, you may see ""SamFromTalkspace"" or whoever comment that they can help address the issue. Definitely another AI that will direct me to the ""live chat"" and not provide any real help. Calling their number leaves me on hold for ten minutes after which a robot tells me there's no one available and hangs up. I'm thinking that's not even a real operating line. 

It's just beyond unacceptable to operate a business in this shady, scammy way. Be warned, I would never use talkspace again (the therapist I had ghosted me btw). But they have some very shady business tactics. 

Wondering if anyone else has suggestions. I don't want to pay before I have proof that I owe for these services, but the chat support is not helping. I don't want my credit report tainted because of this either. Ive reached out to my state's attorney general and am waiting to hear back.

My main substances are alcohol (2-4 beers nightly) and a small amount of Delta 8 nightly. I don't get obliterated or black out ever. The main thing I'm looking for is mental health treatment, like therapy and medication management because I have a history of psychosis, anxiety, depression, trauma and a mood disorder. I've never been violent, self-harmed, or had any legal troubles. The person I scheduled my intake on the phone with reiterated several times that I will likely be referred to inpatient for treatment. I have a 6 year old that I alone am responsible for driving to school and picking up daily, so inpatient would not work for me. However, I really need therapy, and I'm willing to do any kind of outpatient therapy. I'm wondering if, in general, will places let people that are unable to do inpatient do some form of intensive outpatient? I'm worried they're going to be an all or nothing type deal.

1pogain,Looking for advice on getting more out of therapy,"I'm getting frustrated with therapy. 

  
My life is in a pretty bad place right now, and I really need serious help. Beyond that, I have longstanding issues with past academic and career trauma.

I picked a therapist who does EMDR to try that approach, been going weekly for a couple of months, but we haven't started the EMDR stuff yet and I'm getting pretty frustrated. I've done therapy before, and haven't felt super like it led anywhere, so I wanted to try something more like EMDR this time.

  
Some things I'm frustrated with are that I feel like I don't know what I'm doing and that whatever happens in the session, doesn't really end up changing life outside the session. I often leave feeling down or frazzled because we've brought up unpleasant stuff that ultimately doesn't have a resolution or some satisfying progress.

  
Everybody says that I should be in therapy, but when I've actually been in therapy I haven't really felt satisfied or like I was making any change or progress or getting better. This part really stinks because I feel like, I can't quit because people will chastise me for not being in therapy, even if being in therapy isn't helping me.

  
Do you have any tips for making your therapy experience more successful or transformative? I will try anything.

  
Sorry for vagueness, not trying to get into retelling my trauma story. Feel free to ask questions if that will help make the problem more clear.

After informing my therapist of this new condition and medication he asked for the information of the doctor that diagnosed me. I’m not sure why and I didn’t ask. Would my therapist reach out to this doctor without my permission and is he allowed to do that? I’m not hiding anything but I would definitely want to be informed.

1po8z3y,"healthcare workers who got therapy for burnout, did it actually help or just waste of time?","I'm an ER nurse and I've been doing this for 20 years. I love my job, or at least I used to, but the last few years especially with covid have completely destroyed me. I've watched so many people die, dealt with so much abuse from patients and families, worked insane hours with no support, and I'm just done.

I cry in my car before every shift. I'm having nightmares about work. I'm irritable with my family when I get home. I've gained 30 pounds from stress eating. I called in sick twice last month just because I couldn't face going in, which I've never done before in my entire career.

the thing is I'm supposed to be the one who helps people, right? I'm a healthcare professional, I should be able to handle this stuff. asking for help feels like admitting I'm weak or not good at my job. my coworkers are all dealing with the same stuff and they're showing up every day, so what's wrong with me that I can't cope?

but I had a moment last week where I realized if a patient told me they were feeling this way I'd tell them to get help immediately. so why am I holding myself to a different standard? I can't keep pretending I'm fine when I'm clearly not.

I have decent insurance through the hospital, which is ironic considering how broken the healthcare system is. I need to find a therapist who understands healthcare worker burnout specifically because I don't think a regular therapist is gonna get what this job does to you.

I'm also terrified of running into patients or coworkers if I go to a therapist locally, small city and everyone knows everyone in the medical community. telehealth is probably safer for privacy but I've never done video therapy and don't know if it's as effective.

1po7mbi,"Two years of couple's therapy, is it time to switch therapists?","I love my now husband and I think our marriage is pretty good most days. But when I moved in with him about two years ago it was under the agreement that we did couples therapy because things were rough. I am not sure how much the couples therapist has helped and this last session was especially upsetting.

It feels like almost all sessions start with my husband saying I do something that makes him feel like he's lacking a connection with me, and then the therapist interrogates me on this in a way that leaves me confused and frightened. She tells me that I am not involved when I am listening and trying to understand what I am being told, and that I am uninvolved when I say I don't know how I feel or what I need. I constantly feel compelled to make things up just to give her the answers she desires and I'm too frightened to know if what I'm saying is even true or not. It's incredibly confusing and the stakes are terrifyingly high and she insists that she and my husband have been telling me the same thing for two years already and that how I am experiencing the situation is wrong, and that I am not being asked to ""perform"", that somehow I am supposed to be ""natural"" but also the actions tell me that I am supposed to behave in a way she thinks I should. Every time I leave couples therapy I feel like there's something terribly wrong with me, my emotions, my brain.

I know I just need to do the things I am asked better, but also I feel far too much anxiety in therapy to actually make sense of what's going on around me. I know all of this is a ""me"" problem and I need to fix it somehow. But honestly, it's been two years, maybe the therapist is the problem if she doesn't understand that maybe a different approach is required after two years?

1podas4,Is there any sort of therapy that can help me?,"Very specific problem I’ve caused myself so apologizes in advance.

I’ve been dealing with very poor mental health for the past five months due to an intense OCD episode.

My theme during this episode was institutional abuse, usually in hospitals and psychiatric facilities, and my compulsions involved repeatedly reading really horrible stories of mistreatment repeatedly (think 4-6 hours a day). I would then ruminate on the problem and the things I’d read non-stop. In it’s worst I was upset enough to loose 15 pounds.

I am currently in ERP and an SSRI and my OCD has lessened significantly and I’m able to resist compulsions but I feel like I’m traumatized. I’ve filled my brain with so many horrible, graphic things and I have so many fears I didn’t before. I’m terrified of hospitals, nurses, social workers, psychiatrists, etc. I always have to make sure someone is “safe.” When I’m triggered I feel ill and I hurt myself. Someone told me she was studying behavioural psychology and I left to vomit in a parking lot.

My main question is can I benefit from some sort of trauma therapy without risking my progress in ERP? Discussing an OCD theme (for me at least) is the worst possible thing to do, is completely ineffective, and makes the compulsions worse. I don’t know what to do because I don’t feel okay but don’t know if there’s a way for me to address the trauma in this situation because of how it connects with my OCD.

1pocs1j,I am so angry/frustrated right now,"I have my agoraphobia since 2022 and right now it is pretty bad, but I am doing my best to get better. I do exposure every day. I was at my psychiatrist at talked with him about exposure and what else I could do. My hobby is gaming 2-3 hours a day during the week, rest of a day I work for 8-8.5h and do exposure 30-60 Minutes every day during the week, longer at weekends.

Now I just went to my mum after ending my gaming session, my dad talked to one of his people from his job and one said she had a daughter who would game all day and had the same phobia because of gaming and would do withdrawal from gaming for 2 years in a clinic. Now both my dad and mom believe gaming is causing my phobia. Which I talked about with my psychiatrist.

HE SAID IT IS NOT CAUSING IT, he told me how proud he is of me doing exposure consistently every day and that many phobia patients would not be as eager as I am.

But my parents turn everything around so they nullify all my effort and tell me gaming is the reason why I have my phobia. I never had issues with a phobia in my youth. That is why I feel so angry and not appreciated. My dad telling everyone stuff they heard from some non professional people that have completely different situations. My psychiatrist really said gaming was not the reason I have my panic disorder with agoraphobia.

The reason I have my phobia is because I was overwhelmed with too many sensory stimuli on a massive music festival, when I got sober for the first time after 3 days of drinking decently each day.

I don’t know what to do because my parents want to prohibit me gaming now basically despite me showing them how hard I try, I f\*cking hate it.

I am so frustrated and don’t know how I could tell them/actually persuade them that gaming is part of my life and a way for me to calm down from my everyday stress and it does not affect me negatively. I really do much to get better but everything I do seems wrong in the eyes of my parents. I am so filled with frustration, also slowly building some kind of hate the more I get criticized for doing the right things.

1pnxq9g,GF giving me the silent treatment after I told her how her not defending me at her birthday party from her bestfriends comments made me feel betrayedand heartbroken.,"Im not expecting anyone to read this, but i cant sleep, and have no where else to vent my frustrations. 

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for over a year now, our relationship has been very rocky, im a bad communicator, and she loves me to much to let me go.

I have so much to work on in myself as do we all, i get jealous easily, im bad at communicating, and other bad qualities common in young men from conservative households. I also don't have a car so when we hangout she does all tge driving, but her car isn't the best so ive been helping her pay for whatever goes wrong with it, i also usually pay for her gas and tge majority of her meals when we're out, id say the expesives of our relationship are 50/50 in spirit, but her car causes her a lot of stress and she'll take it out on me which is fine because i dont have a car.

Over the past months she would say that ive gotten better, she's seen me put effort in becoming better. And i think so too.

Yesterday was her birthday party. For context one notable thing she's told me is that because she has to spend time driving me around when we hangout, it takes away a lot of time she use to spend with friends.

She wanted me to go to her birthday party, but i didnt want to, but she begged and i conceded eventually. I didnt want to go because her friends would be there, and her friends dont like me, i dont like some of them and they dont like me because i take my girlfriends time.

I really dont talk to my gf at all through tge beginning of the party, and when its time to eat i decide to leave the group, in my head i didnt want to interact with my gf because i didnt want to take her attention away from her friends, and i left the group for that very reason.. now im still nearby.. i over hear her bestfriend calling me a loser for not brining my girlfriend a gift. For context i did get her a gift, but i didnt bring it because it her birthday wasnt the day of her bd party, and 2 i wanted to give her gift 1 on 1, something more intimate, its how weve givin eachother gifts..

But my girlfriend doesnt say anything to defend me.. she stays silent.. for obvious reasons im a little upset but i dont give it much thought.. then its time for my gf to open her gifts, and a little after that my gf tells her bestfriend that me and her mom would give her gifts on her actual birthday.. and her bestfriend responds with i woudnt be driving it(my gift for my gf)

And my gfs mom defends me.. my gf didnt.. and it left me in shambles.. now im quite tge cry baby but im good at holding it in when in public or around guests, this time however it was a little to much to bear, so i went back to where i was, away from the group, not to be seen for the remainder of the party..

A little later she came to look for me asking me to come because they were going to cut the cake.. i told her i didnt want any and insisted on staying where i was, she was obviously annoyed and asked me why i came in the first place, i told her i came because i didnt want to make her mad, and she proclaimed that me leaving the group was not helping.. then she began to walk away and before she did i asked her if after the party if she could take me home, she said yes.

A little later her little brother would come and ask me what was wrong and if i was okay.. it took everything in me not to cry.. but i told him i was fine.. and he accepted it and left.. in that moment i wished it was my gf instead of him and that realization took everything i me and more not to cry.. i wanted to cry so much..

Later when it was coming to a close my gf would ask me what was wrong, i told her id tell her the following day and she obliged.

Come the following morning her birthday.. i woke up earlier then i usually did, slept 6 hours, i began to text her and told you everything i told you guys.

She would simply reply with ""im sorry we didnt mean to make you upset"" and "" you made me upset to for leaving"" and it feels like you dont care about me.. 

I replied with ""thats all you have to say"" and paragraphs and paragraphs of reiterating what i said in more detail..
 She didnt text me for hours after that..

And then she finally told me that she left my gift in the mailbox, our bds are a day apart.

I would proceed to text her even more, call her nonstop and cry cry cry, i was devastated that my gf the girl who told me she loved me many times would abandon me in my own misery..

Hours later she would text me that we'd talk later....

And that the last ive heard from her until now..

Ive redownloaded social media apps to get in touch with her, reactivated old accounts and called her from multiple social media apps..

I love this girl more than i love myself, and thats my problem.

But im not without sin, ive done similar to her when im upset, i think she's returning the favor..

This relationship has become so toxic, this is the first time i say this outloud.

But i love her and always will.

She's been reluctant to break up with me, but im scared that she finally will.

I like the idea of therapy, someone to just vent to and help me.

I tried it with friends but some things I just don't feel comfortable saying, I like the thought of a person who can't tell your secrets to others (unless its dangerous)

1po7ezv,Should I change therapists after a year?,"Hi! 24’M. I’ve been seeing a therapist for a year, initially I had planned only few months but I had more issues than I realized. I am starting to feel a lot of stress and anxiety again, which also might contribute to increased BP and actual physical issues. 

However, towards the end I wasn’t gaining any more skills but just talking about my problems and repeating old strategies, and getting diminishing returns. I’m also a guy and a lot of my problems were related to career anxieties, familial pressures, relationship issues and such and sometime there were things that I didn’t feel so comfortable sharing with female therapist, for example anxieties around sexual performance and such. 

The therapist was, however, brilliant and gave me a lot of strategies. I do miss seeing her but I am wondering if I should find a male therapist and start afresh. It also feels intimidating giving all the context again to a new therapist.

1po62ou,Is my discomfort paranoia or justified?,"I’m in therapy, both individually and marriage counseling. I’m working through several things but one of them is my evolving marriage. My husband and I have recently opened our relationship, it’s still quite early, and other than a foursome we haven’t had any experiences besides exhibitionism at a club for said things. We had set up a profile on an app for enm couples. 

Our marriage counselor asked which one, and I felt immediately uncomfortable. My husband responded without hesitation. My first thought was, was this dude looking for our explicit content online? Why would he need to know which platform we used? His next question involved what my husband’s kinks were. I felt embarrassed with the line of questioning, buried my face and said, “really?!” And he said it was no different than a doctor asking you to cough during an exam, he was a therapist. This question, to me, made a little more sense because my husband has a past of using sexualization, female interactions, and porn as an escape. I can see how knowing kinks may be relevant, but following the other question I felt like we were exposing ourselves to possible voyerism we didn’t sign up for. 

Am I being paranoid?

1po62f6,Stay or Go?,"25M| After a long time of being single I finally met a very sweet older woman who’s pretty much everything I’ve been looking for. She’s 34. I’ve only known her for 2 months and we’ve had a couple bumps in the road but we’ve smoothed things out. 

Right now I’m faced with a problem of time management. I work 7am-3:30pm and I try to be in bed by 9:30-10 so that I don’t hate my life the next morning. I’m usually in the gym and my schedule is very strict when I am but lately I’ve been slacking really hard because I’m just burnt out/depressed. So some days I might come home and not want to talk to anyone, might just wanna play ps5 for a couple hours, might hit the gym. I usually go a couple days without seeing her and she said this is a problem for her. She runs her own business cleaning houses and she has a lot more time on her hands than me. The way I see it I’ve got 4-5 hours after work to decide what I’m gonna do and it feels like if I’m choosing myself, I’m neglecting her and if I choose time with her I’m neglecting myself. I had to tell her that even though I really like her I’m not sure I’m as ready to be a boyfriend as I thought. 

We mutually ended things about a week ago and I’ve been kinda beating myself up over the decision. The only way I’m going to overcome this burn out/depression is to be totally alone so that I can focus on myself. But at the same time I think about how long I was single and how I eventually did get what I prayed for so how can I just walk away from it? We live in a small town with not many options so i fear I’d be alone for a long time again. 

She called me the other night after a week of no contact and we were both happy to hear the others voice again but I just don’t want to lead this girl on. She’s a good woman but I feel like I just can’t be the man she deserves right now. But she’s also putting in an effort for this relationship that not many women are ever going to give.

1pnprpm,Therapist pulled tarot cards on me without asking,"Hello all, I recently moved to a new town and started seeing a new therapist. We have been meeting since the end of last summer. I have had trouble being fully open, and really understanding my own emotions. My therapist has me draw, and write in session from time to time. Last session was like every other, I was absorbed into drawing and reflecting on my week. Once I was done she brought her tarot cards over and explained to me that she uses them from time to time to help her understand how her clients are feeling and explained to me what each one meant and we discussed how it could tie into my experience. Shes never used them while we were talking, but I think shes used them on other occasions while I was drawing or writing and I just didnt notice. I feel a little weird/off about tarot cards, dont get me wrong I dont deem them evil or anything. But I dont personally engage with them or necessarily want to for personal reasons, they simply are not my thing. Im unsure if this is something I bring up to her since it did make me slightly uncomfortable, or if I should just let it go since its just cards and I did resonate with them so it made expressing my emotions easier.

1po5xre,Recovery/Wellness Plan,"Hi, at the end of several runs of therapy (CBT, Schema, integrative) I have been encouraged to put together a recovery plan, a kind of check-list of skills I've learned, insights into my conditions, triggers, behaviours. But I have always ended up abandoning them with the excuse that I don't know how to organise the information. 

A bit of context, I have multiple interactive problems that are complicated because they include both emotional and behavioural elements, and skills that are both longer term (like building self-acceptance) and shorter term (like reducing binging and reducing avoidance). Some are very much skills to respond to triggers the moment and some are more ongoing, and sometimes the triggers (feeling overwhelmed) might need to be tackled by both sets of skills. 

I suppose I'm partly asking how one organises a plan or list of those skills, triggers and insights, and partly I'm feeling overwhelmed not knowing what to focus on, whether to focus on shorter term symptom reduction first or longer term, deeper seated issues. Maybe this is also just classic avoidance, arguing that because behaviours have recurred after symptom reduction I can't return to those behavioural practices until deeper seated issues are resolved.",1,1,2025-12-16 21:42:33,No_Excitement2154,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1po5xre/recoverywellness_plan/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,-0.728,0.12266666666666667,0.0,-1,-0.19386666666666663,0
1pnsz8h,I got into a light argument about the use of AI for therapy. Need other perspectives.,"Ok so for context: I have a friend who has never really been to therapy in her adult life. She's the type of person who says a lot of other people need to go to therapy but never does herself (even though, in my opinion, she has some things she could really work through). I've known her for over a decade now and I've never once told her she should go to therapy because I understand that's a personal choice that needs to be made by someone on their own. We recently had a conversation that went something like this.

CONVERSATION:

Her: I’m actually learning a lot. I am understanding why people use ChatGPT as a therapist AND I am honestly feeling validated in my decision not to actually go to therapy. I do not think the therapists I know would give this logical of advice. Over many years of friendship with (our therapist friend), she never came close to insightful advice

Me: I don’t think (our friend) should be the barometer of therapists to be fair lol

Her: No, but I don’t personally believe that most therapists give great advice. I think there’s a lot of therapy speak that’s given that people use to evade responsibility that ends up being more harmful than good . Not all the time, obviously, but I just dont know how often therapy advice is actually good.

Me: I think the issue of ChatGPT as a therapist is that a therapist can offer insights into you as a person and what you can actually control within yourself when you can't control other external things. Or things that influencing you from your past that you have blindspots up about. It’s not always practical. It’s sometimes just feeling. It does take a while to find a truly good therapist though.

Her: I mean, like human therapists, ChatGPT can only work with what you give them. I think that’s a big reason why regular therapy is so extremely flawed - people give therapists biased information about themselves

Me: Yea but good therapists can read between the lines. Like from the stuff you are giving them and what you are actually doing . And they will call you on it. A bad therapist can mess people up. But good therapists do exist and therapy is a super powerful tool that I do not think can be totally handed off to a robot.

Her: I’m not saying that either. But I think it’s such a crapshoot

Me: It’s like dating. It often takes too long to find the one that is right for you. And our system is stupid . So it’s too expensive to keep cycling through mediocre therapists. Idk I really like mine and she’s given me a lot of super great insight over the last year and a half that has really changed how I think about myself and the people around me. And how I let a situations affect me or what energy I let in anymore. And without that personal relationship with her and the warmth and bond we’ve developed, I don’t think her straight out “advice” or “tactics” would have had as much of an impact on me. She’s the right balance of empathetic but she also calls me out on stuff when she needs to.

\----

She has since stopped responding. Not going to lie, her ""arrogance"" about not needing to see a therapist over the years is a triggering topic for me. I don't know if I'm being a bit too judgmental here or just standing on my values that I feel strongly about. I really feel like AI can not replace human therapists in so many capacities.

I feel like this thread is dual in focus:

1. Talking through/venting the limitations of this particular friendship and whether I may have outgrown this person through my own self-growth journey. This would probably require a lot more context about our dynamics, which, over the years, have been slightly toxic in a few ways.
2. What do you all generally think about AI as a tool for therapy?

1po1y3m,I feel like I've lost her and I love her too much to let go...,"I have no where to go with this so reddit was my only option.

  
so to put you in my perspective. imagine you have been love deprived all your life and all you wanted was someone to love and to be loved by,

you start giving up on love and you just are doing whatever because you don't care anymore.

you meet this girl, she upfront comes to you first, you talk and she gives you her socials.

you start chatting and you realise, she's different, she's not ghosting you or not talking to you, she genuinely wants to listen to you and wants to know what you're doing.

you do all these things with her, one faithful night, she says that she loves you just before hanging up the phone, you are so happy! you finally feel loved, for the next 3 months its just all lovey dovey and all this, she tells you everything, asks if you're okay, says all this and that, you are finally happy, she takes a vacation to another country for 2 weeks, the distance is so far you can't message frequently, before this you would call and text for hours on end, but you find out that..

she has a boyfriend now... 

at first you say to yourself ""as long as she is happy"" (as tears screen down your face)

you start to get depressed, she's acting like nothing happened, you be honest with her and tell her that you aren't doing okay, you can't exactly say ""oh I don't want you to have a boyfriend because I think I would be better"" because that's not how I feel, I genuinely want her to be loved and happy and I love her with all my heart, she has made me more happy than I have been in years.

last night she woke up to my wall of text I sent her the day before, she kept tell me all these things and was reassuring me, but at the time I felt better, but the more I thought about it, I started to think, ""is she just saying this to make me feel better or does she actually mean it?""

  
you see.

  
its not that I don't want her to be happy, its not that I want them to break up.

  
its that I'm questioning what else I could have possibly done, I was so happy with her, she made me so happy so warm. but she told me that she too was very love deprived and sad,

but now it seems like she just used me to fix her self esteem, feel better about myself, and then kick me in the dirt after she was done with me, you see we are still really close, like really really close, its strange to me because even though she still has a boyfriend to this day, for examples we still have (matching pfp's, ,matching emojis in our names, she still says that she loves me, she still says all these things, i'm still her ""sweet boy"" ""my cutie"" ""my sweet cutie"" ""and nicknames for my real name"" I don't feel comfortable sharing my name or her name. I just need someone to read this because I have nowhere else to go, I've tried talking this out with Chat GPT, I can't even tell most people I know because I know that eventually somebody is gonna tell someone else and so on.

please someone take their outlook on this and help me because I am genuinely hurting.

  
im sorry for any bad grammar or spelling mistakes I had no time to read this out and I am just pouring my emotions into this text now, even this isn't fully how I feel and is just a quick summery.

  
thanks.

1pnb1rw,My therapist ended my session and nearly destroyed me.,"I had a very rough week, and really wanted to talk to my therapist today. I had a very strong discussion with my father, and was very sensitive.

The therapist started the session doing (saying) something I asked her not to do, and instead of empathizing, took it personal and ended the session. Not even 10 minutes from the start.

Maybe something I said was offensive, but even in that case, doesn't therapists have tools to deal with the patient. One that also gave advice of not being well at all? Is this normal?

IDK. I want  to understand.

Edit: I asked her to not use a shorter versión of ny name that I don't like to be called anymore, and I was somewhat annoyed that she insisted with that name. She didnt apologize and I said that the mistake is OK, but that I felt the absence of an apology like she wasn't taking enough care of me, and that in a place like a therapy session, that kind of behaviour makes me feel bad. I don't think I was abusive, I didn't raise my voice, or anything. I was visibly annoyed at first, and feeling hurt when she didn't apologize. I hope this better explains what happened.

1pnzsvw,This world is cruel isn't it?,"Just like every day, mom would pick me up from school. I'm 17 now, yet still feel like a little kid. The sky was grey, the weather was a bit cold, yet much warmer than yesterday, which I was glad of.

Pass the streets, the cars, the people, and I thought about what I would leave behind if I disappear. Somehow, they all felt very strange to me, as if I did not belong to this world I am living in anymore. Suddenly the thought of getting on a random bus and going to somewhere new crossed my mind. Somewhere no one could find me. Not my dad, nor my mom, nor any close friends. I just wanted to go somewhere alone, to find myself again, to embrace my own thoughts, to leave everything behind, to avoid facing my ex, to avoid the insurmountable amount of homework, to stop facing my mom - who I know would never take my mental health seriously, and to hide away from all the pain and past traumas.

But reality hit me hard. I went home, turned on the TV, and laid lazily on the couch. Potato couch, they say. I felt nothing. I felt empty. Yet so peaceful. My mom was out buying food, and no one was there to bother me. 

After maybe half an hour, my mom got home. She started complaining about my little brother, then her colleagues, and about how teenagers nowadays rant incessantly about mental health. ""Back in my day, no one had depression,"" she said. And it hurt me deeply. I wanted to tell her about the hardships I am enduring everyday, but I couldn't. She wouldn't care, and I know she would blame it on the lack of exercise and excessive phone use. So I kept my mouth shut, and started making dinner.

Shower. When was the last time that I took a shower? I think it was 3 weeks ago. I hide my body smell with deoderants, and wear thick clothes to hide the dead skin. I did try to shower. I couldn't. The thought of touching water terrified me. Whenever mom tells me to take a shower, I would quickly change my clothes, wet the floor to pretend as if I had washed myself properly, and wait a few minutes to get out of the bathroom. 

I don't know when I started skipping meals. The last time I had breakfast was properly weeks ago. Not that my schedule is busy. I just had no sense of hunger. I wanted to save money too. So yeah, no breakfast has become a ritual. There are days I skip both breakfast and lunch. I don't feel hungry, never. I eat because mom wants me to, and it is never an enjoyable experience.

Now I'm sitting here on my kitchen floor, typing these lines while my mom is showering. I need to start making dinner now, before my mom gets out of the shower and finds out I have not done anything yet. But I just can't. I'm so tired. I want to take a rest from everything. I want to sleep and never wake up. I want to go somewhere silent, with nothing but me and nature. But I'm so helpless. I don't know where to ask for help. I want to escape from this world terribly.

1pntw9j,I’ve got my first crush. Why does it make me wanna vomit?,"There’s this girl in my class. She’s older than me, significantly cheerier and social, bright, caring, and generally just a good person. She for real tries to help me. I don’t wanna like her, but I do. Whenever I see her I actively avoid her. Seeing her makes me feel sick in the stomach.

I know she doesn’t like me back. I’m kinda glad. I’d rather just stay friends, but I do like her. I don’t know why I like her, I really wish I didn’t because I think we already have a good platonic relationship.

I think it’s because she told me she’s proud of me. If somebody can be proud of something that struggles to improve, that can barely push itself forward… then maybe it’s worth continuing to improve. It’s really sad to say this, but I think I’m closer to her than my own mother. And me and my classmate aren’t even that close. I know nothing about her and she knows so much about me.

Although, I do have one gripe. She’ll ghost me and avoid me for up to like 3 days at a time after we talk. It really hurts me. I’m so pathetic, I can’t even let her have her own space. I’m lucky she’s even being nice to me at all, let alone validating me and talking through some issues. I can’t believe I have the nerve to complain about her leaving me after helping me.

I disgust myself. 

I just want everything to go back to how it was. I’ve never liked anybody before this, not even sexually. I’m glad I’m not a gooner freak. That’s the only good thing to come of my lack of affection.

I can’t talk to people, I have no friends, I suck at all my hobbies, I cry myself to sleep, and I really have the nerve to yearn for somebody? I don’t think I’ll ever deserve to even yearn for somebody, let alone genuinely pursue somebody.

1pns36d,Help firing therapist,"I’ve been seeing my current therapist for about two years. I had my doubts about it working from the start, but dismissed them as anxiety and have been trying my very best to be open and engaged in the process. I feel like we just never “clicked”. I’ve been too scared to break it off because of the aforementioned anxiety and fear of confrontation. 

At this point, I really feel like it’s time to move on. I’ve tried multiple times to talk about the ways our sessions aren’t working for me, and nothing changes. I can feel them actually making my trust issues worse as I expose my vulnerabilities only to have them misunderstood or to be offered extremely basic advice. 

Is it ok to fire him with a brief and professional email? Or would that be rude considering how long I’ve been seeing him? I am worried that if I don’t do it via email I won’t do it at all because of how much anxiety I have around verbal communication. 

I saw some advice saying a therapist would like to have some understanding of the issues that led me to quit; however, I really don’t think this would be productive with him because my main issue is consistently feeling misunderstood in session. Do you think I need to offer/will he request a “debrief” session where I need to be prepared to lay out my reasons? 

I’ve drafted up an email, does something like this sound OK? 

“I wanted to let you know that after careful reflection, I’ve decided to end our sessions together. I believe it’s time for me to move in a different direction, and I’d like to explore different therapeutic techniques and communication styles.

1pntdsc,Is this transference or something else?,"Background

I have been in therapy for ~2.5 years with my T. When I first started I was so nervous about going to therapy and overwhelmed with the life events at the time that no thoughts of attachment came in. Fast forward 6-8 months - she had helped me through that difficult situation and I felt profound gratitude for her and lucky that we clicked. I slowly began to look up to her as a mentor and a role model for improving my emotional intelligence and curiosity. Around that same time, maybe shortly after, I started noticing physical attraction. Small things like just noticing that she looks well put together.

Around the 1 year mark I moved quite far away and my long term relationship became (temporarily) long distance. As this physical distance allowed me the space to see my relationship differently, my T and I began focusing on that in our work. As a result of that work, I was able to identify, name, and validate things that I desired that I wasn't getting from my relationship.

Because this was a place where I didn't know anyone, I basically went to work and back (other than the occasional attempt to socialize). In that time period, the weekly sessions with my T was the second most human contact behind my girlfriend. In hindsight, this is where the ""Idealization"" started, or at least ramped up. Also the emotional attraction / admiration. I was getting the female emotional visibility, and sense of connection that comes with it, that I craved from my partner. She had, by this point, helped me through several life transitions and expanded my way of thinking with thoughtful questions and occasionally calling me on my BS, in a kind, gentle, intelligent manner.

Yes, I understand that this is what therapists are trained to do, and I (think I) understand this is textbook transference, but my attraction is really towards the combination of high emotional and analytical intelligence that she has, not necessarily the positive outcomes she helped me achieve. We also occasionally discuss a wide range of topics in our sessions and through that I have learned she is (like me) very curious about and knowledgeable on a range of topics -- something my partner is not.

Around the 1.5 year mark is roughly when the feelings of physical attraction grew stronger / more frequent. In my desperation to not be alone, I convinced myself that once my partner moved, that would resolve my loneliness. When she finally moved a few months later, it certainly solved the literal loneliness, but I found myself still intellectually lonely. I enjoyed my work with my T for working on myself, but also the mental stimulation that brought.

As all of these feelings grew, eventually they showed up as fantasies about my T. Like the rest of it, these were very mild and infrequent at first, but have recently (within the past few months) grown more intense -- sexualized fantasies where she expresses interest in a relationship.

Notes / comments

 -I understand the roles and boundaries of therapist and client, I hold tremendous professional respect for my T, and I would not ever try to act on these fantasies!

-I understand that this is illusionary; I am basing this all on a curated professional side of her.

-I've been avoiding this elephant for a while. I suspect that my therapist at least suspects this is going on. I am D R E A D I N G having to bring this up. 95% of that is worried that I may stumble over my words, give the the wrong impression about what my intentions are or that she would be angry/upset/disgusted (even if she didn't outwardly show it) and refer me out. The other 5% is embarrassment, selfishness and, frankly, disgust from these thoughts/feelings.

-The little bit of data I have to go on is ~8 months in I was reflecting on our progress and, while trying to thank her / complement her for her help, she quickly shut it down before I could get half a sentence out -- as if she sensed it was going somewhere else and didn't want to open that can of worms.

-I am (outside of therapy) very, very closed off about my emotions due to past trauma. That is improving, but I am still very close guarded. Inside therapy, I've developed complete trust with my T to be able to share my deepest/most uncomfortable thoughts, but that's because she is an external listener. Since these feelings are about her, that safety falls apart. I see this as a potential positive opportunity for her to observe this.

1pnil56,Therapists that repeat your feelings back to you?,"I recently started therapy to deal with some anxiety and sadness I’ve been experiencing due to infertility and struggling through the IVF process.

I’ve seen a few different therapists/psychiatrists: I initially had a few meetings with the infertility psychiatrist at the IVF clinic, and then I tried seeing a therapist from a different practice, and then she ended up leaving that practice and I got assigned to a new therapist.

One thing I’ve noticed all the therapists seem to do is, when I tell them something I’m worrying or feeling sad about, they essentially just repeat back what I’ve said to me. And for some reason I really don’t like it? For example, I’ll tell them I’m feeling really sad about the three failed embryo transfers I’ve done and I’m afraid of the next one not working either, and they’ll repeat back to me something like, “So it sounds like you’re worried about the upcoming embryo transfer because you’ve experienced failure with previous embryo transfers.” And I’ll be like, “yes.” And then we’ll sit there quietly for a moment, like she’s waiting for me to say something else. But that feels conversationally weird to me; isn’t it her turn to say something? Does she just want me to keep talking, or….?

I wonder if it would be rude to ask my therapist to do this less. Whenever she does it, it totally takes me out of the moment and makes me feel like we’re not having a real conversation, like she is just following a kind of script to show she is listening? But I already know she is listening, she doesn’t have to prove it to me. I don’t know, though; it seems like therapists in general do this (my previous one did as well, though to a lesser extent, as did the infertility psychiatrist), so I also don’t want to force her to change what she is trained to do, if that makes sense.

Tl;dr: Is it okay to ask your therapist to stop repeating things back to you? Mine does this a lot and I don’t like it, but I also don’t want to be rude or to force her to stop something that she has been trained to do.",7,2,2025-12-16 02:17:20,Muchado_aboutnothing,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pnil56/therapists_that_repeat_your_feelings_back_to_you/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,-0.2998,-0.060450089126559685,0.0,-1,-0.10203001782531194,0

she has been talking a lot about how eating certain foods is ""a thing that fat people would do"" and how she is ugly (which she isn't). i've been concerned for her because i know that this kind of behavior typically leads to bad eating habits and malnourishment later in life. my mom just restricted her social media access but she definitely needs professional help.

1pntfrz,Took a picture of my therapists office. Will she remove me as a client?,"I, 20F, was driving around tonight, just going as straight for as long as possibly because I needed to and only turned when I felt the compulsion to, unless I got distracted by emotionally significant places I recognized and drove around them instead. I just felt so lost. I’m still sitting in my car while I type this. I ended up in the parking lot of my therapy office, and I looked up from my car to the window that I look out of while in therapy.

I wanted to feel connected I guess)

But I feel weird about it. Like I did something wrong and creepy and violated a boundary or maybe it was illegal. And if I tell her what I did, she’ll think I’m a danger to her and terminate me as a client or report me to the police because maybe it Is illegal because the parking lot has one of those no trespassing signs.

1pnoc21,Seeking advice about cancellation fee - from client perspective,"Hi all,

I’m a client writing about my experience with a therapist who charged me a cancellation fee, and I’m looking for some advice about whether to continue or end things with my therapist. For some context, I’m a graduate student who has been seeing my therapist since January about once a week (so coming on 40+ sessions or so), and have never cancelled a session. I use student insurance for my therapy and my income is quite limited. I generally like this therapist and have found them quite warm and empathetic. Our sessions have mostly been in person (about an hour commute each way from my house) though recently over zoom. 

I’ve been traveling each week for the past six weeks for conferences and family things so we’ve switched to zoom but still kept the once a week appointment cadence. This past week, I was coming back from an international trip and one of the layovers en route was cancelled due to a severe windstorm (for context, I am a frequent traveler, and it’s one of the scariest flights I’ve ever been on, we attempted to land three times and failed each time, and a passenger had to be taken care of paramedics when we landed in our alternate destination.)

My return home was delayed by one day and I had to cancel/reschedule my therapy appointment. I let my therapist know and they offered to reschedule. We eventually ended up meeting that same week. I thought things ended there, but on a whim logged into my therapy portal and saw that I was charged a cancellation fee by them (but they never mentioned it in my emails to them). 

I was quite frustrated about this since I’ve shared quite openly and regularly both my struggles to maintain a regular income and that this fee would be challenging for me. During the session, I also shared how I was extremely worried about the cancellation fee during the flight ordeal and emailed them as soon as I could. I event spent tons of time researching why therapists have cancellation fees, different approaches to them, how some have “one freebie,” etc. This therapist’s policy is <24 hrs cancellation = $100 fee (not the end of the world, but not significant) with no exceptions listed in his paperwork (although they waive it for “emergencies,” and they only cited a bike accident as one example of this). We spent the rest of the session discussing what precisely constitutes an “emergency,” with me maintaining that my situation did and them maintaining that it didn’t, but they acknowledged how tough the situation was. 

For me this was a bit of a turning point, as I began to become more frustrated about a) spending tons of emotional energy and labor justifying my own “value” to them as a client as I’ve always been regular and conscientious otherwise, b) them citing other examples where they had to pay a cancellation fee, including when another client had suicidal ideation (!!!), and c) them stating that they didn’t want to be “blackmailed” by me to waive it (their words). They mentioned that they have a strict cancellation fee for “income protection” purposes, and I sympathize with that, but I wanted them to acknowledge the power dynamics in the room. 

As I mentioned earlier, I liked them as a therapist but found them immediately and surprisingly cold and unsympathetic to my plight after this session - we basically spent it litigating the fee which neither of us wanted to do. We both discussed how this is not really about the cancellation fee itself, but what it signifies: who matters in the room, what constitutes an “emergency,” and what my “progress” has been like so far.

I told them I’m considering cancelling sessions going forward given how frustrating this experience was and what new information it revealed to me about this therapist, but we agreed to have another session in mid-January as I’m traveling until then. Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated!

1pnsz4x,"If you’ve been in therapy a long time, did you accept your looks?","I used to be insecure about my body. Now it’s developed into a different body type and I’m focused on refining it and improving my health a1c, muscle to fat ratio, endurance.

But what is a real bother for me is my hair and face. I feel like I look like Mrs. potato in the face. I never got picked on for my nose but that and the roundness of my face is what bothers me.

I’m considering rhinoplasty at this point bc I’ve been in therapy for multiple years and haven’t managed to change my mind. 

My feelings about my appearance have been discussed but we haven’t done any series of specific interventions to work on my beliefs about my appearance.

When I was younger there was a dark skinned girl with a wide nose and the other kids would call her gorilla.

My nose is in my opinion too wide and lacks a defined bridge. 

Im thinking to get a nose job so Ill be more happy with how I look. For reference I’d like it to look like the pretty Somali brides in Pinterest. That way it would good without having a completely weird vibe. 

Nobody gets a nose job to make their nose wider, bigger or less defined like mine. Girls with my nose and round face aren’t popular online and we never have been popular for that look online.  

I grew up being made fun of for “talking white”, being nerdy and awkward, not having the right clothes and my crushes never liked me back

. Now years later I get more appreciative glances in public and have a very handsome person who thinks me and my natural hair and face are beautiful. 

  

Ppl prefer faces that have feminine softened yet balanced with some light / moderate angularity like a heart shape face.

As for my hair I have below average density / amount of hair so I wear extensions/ wigs daily. Often in straight or body waves or water wave / deep wave textures. 

My natural hair texture isn’t bad and my hair looks fuller in its natural texture but it’s more maintenance to wear it natural and it makes me look too young.

So should I ask my therapist for targeted interventions for improving my feelings about my natural appearance? Or just start saving for surgery?

1pnsvqw,How to know if my therapist is the right fit for me?,"I started going to therapy properly since 2023 with a therapist that also had a popular podcast. I really liked her podcast then became a client (after a while of listening to it) for a year. Being well familiarised with her content eased the transition to being a client. The issue was that she only offered online services and I was renting with roomates so I didn’t feel like I had total privacy when discussing my issues at home. 

This year I made it a goal to find someone who offered in-person therapy and called up maybe 5-6 therapists around the areas if I liked their profile and asked them lots of questions about approaches. I ended up going to this one lady because I feel like she was quite interesting career-wise and her voice on the intake call was quite soothing, which made me feel safe. I was in a transitional career stage and wanted support if someone’s been through similar stuff, but we haven’t been doing much work about career. 

I’ve had 6 sessions up to this point, but I never really feel like she & I had a click. I don’t really walk out of sessions feeling totally changed, or my state coming in and out of her office is quite similar, though improved. I notice but never really said out loud to her that maybe my problems were too much for her from her body language or often being asked to slow down a bit. I don’t feel like I’m seen entirely, mostly because she preferred referring back to a structured modality to talk about my problems, rather than just letting me freestyle them. 

She’s a very nice, lovely lady and seeing her does help me, but I don’t really know if I should continue seeing her if I don’t feel the click? She’s not in practice for long, but I don’t think experience plays a role but more like style?

I’ve realized something about myself that I need to work on, but I’m not exactly sure how to go about it.

When my SO is feeling bad, whether it’s because he’s angry, sad, irritated, annoyed, etc., I tend to feel like it’s my job to make him feel better. And I feel really bad when I don’t ""succeed"", like I failed at my job.

Sometimes, he’ll tell me to ignore it and just act like normal, like nothing’s wrong, because the thing making him upset is not even related to me, but I just… can’t. I start overthinking everything I do or say and somehow just make it more awkward. 

The thing is… I never feel that way with friends or family. I know that life is not all rainbows and butterflies and all emotions are welcomed. When they feel bad, I know how to be there for them without feeling like I need to make them feel better. I try really hard to be normal and have the same kind of acceptance in relationships, but I really don’t know how to do it.

(nothing bad, just failure to connect and stay connected.) 

If I'm being completely honest there was some other non sponsor related triggers that drove me to persue thearapy. But thats for context- not really here or there. 

More context: Finished my second session today- Ive got serious doubts about the arangement. but I always have serious doubts about thearapy working and never really experienced a break through. Usually I get annoyed hearing the same thing everytime and quit.

I've changed my approach this time, about what I want to talk about and I shared some pretty heavy stuff today. My thearpist, sighed heavily repeated my name a few times while shaking her head. 

I chuckled, I have a pretty good sense of humor and honestly that doesnt bother me. I just said, ""hey im glad I'm not bringing you something easy.""

I guess- Im sick and tired of being sick and tired I need help, I need to work through my shit but... 

The Question:

How long do you go before you decide to see a different therapist. I dont know how any of this shit is suppoesed to work or how to vet. I know I'm fracked in the head but i also feel like the only way forward is just to commit....

1pnux7o,"I was diagnosed with autism, but I think I have intellectual disability, as well. Do you think my actions in this story prove I have intellectual disability?","Last November, on a Tuesday, at around 4 pm, I had gone over to a public elementary school that I went to as a child (the school day there normally ends at 3:20 pm, but on this day the school day ended at 12 pm, since it was a half school day because it was a parent-teacher conferences day) to play on the swings. I thought that I wasn't doing anything wrong since the school day had long since ended, and there were NO kids at the school at the time. After I was done playing on the swings, I walked around the building (on the outside, not the inside), and I was looking in the windows as a way of strolling down memory lane. That’s when some staff members saw me and freaked out. But it was still after school hours.

A man then came out and asked me what I was doing. I told him that I was just walking around, and that I didn't mean any harm (since they seemed alarmed by my presence). He then told me that I couldn't be there during ""school time"" (which I found odd since I was fairly certain that the school day had ended several hours ago) and went back inside (does parent-teacher conference time count as ""school time?""). I then left the school grounds feeling very shaken and embarrassed. Then, when I got to the parking lot, the principal of the school came out, stopped me, and demanded to know what I was doing. I told him that I had just come to play on the swings, and then he shouted at me in a very harsh and angry voice ""DO YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE TRESPASSING ON SCHOOL PROPERTY?!?!"" I then said ""But, the school day is over"" to which he replied ""Yeah, and the gate is closed!"" Looking back on it, I realize that I hadn't done the greatest job explaining my point of view to him, but then again, he was being very aggressive and not giving much of an opportunity to speak. After he was done scolding me, he asked me if I lived nearby, to which I answered yes, and then when I approached my car, he demanded sharply and urgently ""is this your car?!?!"" to which I (naively) responded yes. He then took a picture of my license plate with his iPhone. I opened my mouth to ask him why he did that, but he cut me off before I even had a chance to speak, and sharply demanded that I ""dismiss myself"", so I left.

Fearing that the people at the school would give that picture to law enforcement so that I could be tracked down and arrested, I decided to send a message to the principal of school on LinkedIn that evening explaining what happened, and asking him to please not report me to the police. Realizing I had made a bad choice by sending that message, I deleted my LinkedIn account the next morning. The next day, in the afternoon, I decided to call the elementary school as an anonymous caller, to see if I could find out what information they had on the incident from the previous day, and what they were planning to do about it. I called the main office, and I asked them if there had been any trespassing incidents that had occurred at the school recently, and the person said on the phone that they did not have access to that information and hung up. Then, a few minutes later, the main office called me back, and it was the principal on the line (I could sense great aggression behind that phone call). The principal said in a firm authoritative that he had been told that I was inquiring about a trespassing incident, and asked who I was. I then said that I was an anonymous caller, and he said that he would not give any information to anonymous callers. He then said ""is this \[my first name\] \[my last name\],"" to which I said no, but to which my heart then sank because that let me know that he had read my message before I deleted my LinkedIn account. I then said that I had to hang up, and then he hung up.

The evening of the day after that, since I was still feeling anxious, I decided to contact one of the teachers that I had in elementary school on Facebook. I explained to her what happened, I asked her if there had been any notification sent out about what I did, and I also asked her if she felt that I deserved to be punished for what I did. She responded the next morning, telling me that she never heard anything about it, and that I wasn't in any trouble.

However, she apparently brought my messages to the attention of someone, because later that day, some security guards from the school came knocking on the door of my house. No one was home to answer the door, but my mom and brother saw them on the security camera of our house, and they freaked out (I had told them about what happened the day before). My mom called me but I didn't answer. I started heading home because I knew something was up, and then when I got to the house, my brother shouted out to me to pull over. He then explained to me what was going on, and told me to stay home because mom was scared, but I drove away as he turned around to speak to my mom on the phone. I then went into a parking lot, called the main office, and I told them my name and that the principal wanted to talk to me about something. The principal wasn't in that day, so the security person at the school spoke to me instead. He told me that I wasn't in any trouble and that I didn't need to worry, but but he told me not to go back to the school for any reason, and to not get in touch with any of the teachers at the school (the teacher who I contacted has since blocked me on Facebook). I then texted my mom brother letting them know that everything was okay, but they never answered me, so I decided to go home. I then found out that they hadn't responded to me because my brother had gone to pick my mother up from her job and bring her home. My mom had also called the main office, and they explained to her everything that had happened and was happening. (Apparently, one of the people who saw me said that I was knocking on windows, which is not what I was doing!). She then told me to stay home, because she had been told that the security guards were going to come back to the house, and that they would have to speak to me in person. We then waited, but after two hours, I got tired of waiting and decided to go out anyway…

1pnba7v,"With huge debt, medical issues & suicidal thoughts, how can I help my brother?","My brother had a relationship turn sour some years ago. Since then, things have seemed downhill for him. He lives beyond his means and is nearly out of money. He has a temporary job that only goes for periods of time, then may or may not come back. It doesn't pay super well. He's 100k in debt in credit cards and another 100+k in student loans. He has claims of every medical disorder under the sun from depression, lyme disease, bi-polar, schizophrenia, cancer, brain damage, etc. 

He has a big dog that burdens him from living more cheaply, but it's his best friend. 

In past jobs he's always been argumentative and couldn't keep them. Reading and staying focused are issues, as is ADHD.

The last few months he's had many many suicidal thoughts. The pit of despair too far to dig out of. I listen, he can talk for hours, 5, 6, 7, 8 hours straight sometimes hashing out the past.

He's getting older, near 40, wants a family, wants the life he's always wanted, the rest of his family and friends around him have already done so. But he hasn't been able to start that.

He's been in therapy for along time, switched therapists before. Been on different medications over the years, went off all together, back on, off again. Trying to find the 1 thing wrong with him that explains all the problems.

I want to help him, I want him to be safe. But I don't know how. I can't buy him a house, he can't live with me or our sibling. I can't just give him money, that goes nowhere. I listen, I tell him focus on a better job.

Looking for advice on how to help, or what he can do to help himself. He wants help.

1pnea5e,Can someone explain how therapy is supposed to work?,"27M, dad died when I was 14, in addition to now social/isolation issues paired with addictions. I've been going to therapy my entire life and I still have no idea what it is supposed to be doing for me. I'm definitely a highly anxious and self aware person, and find it very difficult to elaborate on any thoughts or emotions, which makes therapy harder. It's common for me to bounce around all kind of ideas without any linear pattern.

I starting seeing a woman over a year ago with the intention of quitting my addictions. After several months I got into a groove and managed to drop some substance/digital habits. This is the most ""sober"" I've been in 10 years, I now have access to parts of my brain that weren't there before. However throughout all of this, we haven't really discussed anything of value/substance at all, she's not very stern with any direction or ideas and each week seems to roll into the next. To be frank, I think I just caught a wave and rode it. I don't feel therapy has helped much at all. I feel stuck between addiction and sobriety now, and cravings are starting to come back.

People mention the dark cloud that comes after getting sober and how it can last for a long time. Also how emotional debt needs to be worked through after the fact. I don't want to discredit this woman, because every day seems like a roller coaster now and I can be all over the place. But we really aren't working on anything, something new always seems to be popping up and stealing the spotlight.

1pnd1ot,"I wish I met the person she used to be, not the one her fears made","You’re probably tired of seeing me here talking about the same situation, but the truth is that things keep getting more confusing.

I met a girl about a year ago and we formed a very strong connection. We eventually got involved, but the relationship ended because of the distance. Since then, there was never a clean break. We talked occasionally, always in an undefined space.

During that time, she tried getting close to someone else. According to her, it was an attempt to replace what she felt for me, but it didn’t work. She says she still has feelings for me and that if it weren’t for the distance, she would have never ended things.

Yesterday, she asked if we could get back together, but taking it slow. I said no. I want a relationship with clear intention. If we get back together, it’s to build something real, not to live with uncertainty. She said she will resolve the distance issue and that I don’t deserve confusing situations in my life, but she doesn’t actually know how she’s going to do that.

Every time we talk about this, she says she feels bad and feels like she is the problem. At the same time, I can’t help but wish I had met the version of her that her ex did, not someone so consumed by fear.

Yesterday I looked at some of her old TikTok reposts from when she was still with her ex. She talked a lot about long distance relationships, about how distance can make you want someone even more, how it hurts but is worth it, and how you shouldn’t deny yourself love because of distance. The breakup with her ex wasn’t even because of distance, but because he was emotionally immature. Seeing those posts now left me even more confused, because it feels like those beliefs changed when it became real with me.",2,0,2025-12-15 22:46:16,HotUse4099,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pnd1ot/i_wish_i_met_the_person_she_used_to_be_not_the/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,0.292,0.0357912457912458,-0.6295257210731506,-1,-0.22000461137832616,-1
1pncz6o,I've mentally lost the plot.,"**I just feel like i don’t know anything anymore.**

For context I (20M) have been struggling mentally for about the past year or two now (for longer than that honestly but the current problem started then).

I moved abroad to study engineering. There I got accepted into a house where i had to live with 8 others. I noticed quite quickly that there was a certain disconnect in how social interactions functioned over there than over here. I felt a bit disconnected also because they spoke in a dialect I wasn't used to and more often felt a bit excluded because I missed a lot of their culture. This along with the mounting pressure of studying abroad and it being expensive as hell led me to get debilitating panic attacks.

I didn’t really feel comfortable in sharing this with my housemates which in turn resulted in me being more withdrawn this then led to the stress that if I didn’t perform on a social level they would kick me out of the house and I would have to return home. Eventually this happened because they didn’t feel I was a good fit for them and I moved back home. Although in the end I think this was for the best since engineering really wasn’t for me it still left me in quite a shit state.

The panic attacks didn’t go away. They stayed up until the point where I started dating my girlfriend at the time. Everything was great I took 6 months off from studying and worked to save up some money. The next year when I started studying again I fell into a really bad spiral of being dissilusioned with life itself a few months after having broken up with my girlfriend at the time. (I mention this because I think it comes into play later.)

This spiral had me abusing alcohol and doing a bit of subtle self harm such as banging my head against walls and pouring semi-boiling water over my hands. My main conviction at the time was that I’ve never really felt happy for a long enough time to constitute staying alive, since the risk wasn’t worth the reward. This lasted for about a good 4 months.

I want to say that the main feeling at the time was just feeling disconnected from everyone and everything. I was jealous of others for simply being happy and felt like a bitter person. This in turn made me feel like a horrible person which then justified my feeling of it being better if I wasn’t around, along with the fact that I just couldn’t imagine ever feeling like others. The thought also popped up that perhaps I wasn’t actually feeling anything out of the ordinary but just was worse at coping with life than others.

When I started going to therapy again I was convinced to stick around long enough to figure out what was wrong at least. I did and things started going better. I went through a period of 4 months where I had extremely poor days which felt like the negative ‘everything sucks’ spiral again but also days or even weeks where I felt like I was on top of the world.

This also faded and for the past 5 months I’ve been back to a semi regular existence. I feel fine most of the time but two days a week I feel horrible again. I always thought this was the disconnect again, but today something became amazingly clear to me. I think I am just incredibly Insecure about everything.

I think this started with going abroad where I felt like I was the odd one out and got amplified by my 8 roommates, who I really thought I got along with, deciding behind my back to kick me out because ‘It just wasnt a good fit’. The panic attacks I experienced, looking back were always triggered by a feeling of disconnect. It always sent me into a spiral of thinking: “everybody hates me and they are right to feel this way”

I believe the only reason they went away while i was with my girlfriend at the time was because when those thoughts popped up i always had the thought ‘someone loves me enough to be my girlfriend’ to soothe me and to negate the reasoning of “everybody hates me and they are right to feel this way”. I think this is why shortly after we broke I experienced that horrible period of wanting to kill myself. It never went away, I just could refute that thought at the time.

My therapist thinks it’s also deeply rooted in how my homelife was, but never made the connection which I just explained, which I can agree with because a week ago i had a breakdown because i’m now convinced even my own sister dislikes me.

The two days a week i experience now are usually also triggered by a social situation in which there’s a sudden clue as to why people would dislike me. I take small jokes the wrong way and then shut down socially like some high schooler. 

I lost my train of thought somewhere in between the lines of writing these posts, but I remember thinking: “I just need someone to tell me I’m not a terrible horrible shithead of a person” and most importantly I need to believe it, or at least have some evidence as to why I’m not because the rejection far outweighs the positives. Even with people who I regularly hang out with, I’m convinced they don’t actually like me but just tolerate me and would rather have me around than being alone, even that statement i sometimes question. Half of the time I’m convinced they’re just too shy to now say they don’t want to hang out anymore. 

Anyways, i feel like I lost the plot.

For context I'm a minor, autistic and have selective mutism as well as horrible thrust issues and severe anxiety and a series of other issues that may or may not have names or even be relevant (also english isn't my first language so I apologize in advance for any mispelling or grammatical errors). I've been going to this therapist since I got diagnosed (with autism) this February, she's genuinely one of the sweetest, kindest people I've ever met, she's funny, she doesn't make any conversation feel too heavy or awkward which helps me a lot for when it comes to opening up. She's always seemed very caring and honestly I've been Improving — even if slowly — since I started seeing her. Then I saw that stupid ass post on twitter like a few weeks ago and even tho I still go to therapy most of the time and act like usual when I go I can't help but constantly think that my therapist doesn't actually care about me, that she doesn't actually want to see me, that she doesn't care about my issues, that she's only doing it because it's her job, etc etc. And don't get me wrong, of course therapists only do what they do because it's their jobs in a way, but I also used to think that over time they started caring abt their patients individually, as a person, and that single dumbass post shattered all the trust and ""love"" I had for my therapist as a person. I'm most definitely overreacting but idc this is what I feel and I need answers.

1pn7bwh,I miss my old therapist and can't find the motivation to start over with a new one,"Hi! I started therapy last year and stuck with it for six months because I worked through what I needed to figure out with their help and also I couldn’t afford it anymore. We did a lot of great work together and I grew under her support. 

I’ve since moved to a different state and I feel like that in itself been challenging in addition to other life things (I’m in my 20s just trying to figure out what is going on lol). I know therapy would be helpful but all I can think about is my therapist who is licensed only in the state I moved from. She understood me, was everything I was looking for in a therapist and I honestly would like to just start where we left off. I can’t see myself opening up to someone new — that sounds exhausting in its own self. It’s honestly what’s holding me back from finding a new therapist. But I also need support. 

This sucks. I don’t see many people talking about how it sucks to miss an old therapist and just want to work with them but can’t due to state guidelines.

1pncc1y,"Please, answer me as soon as possible. I don’t know how to go on living","
I suffer from anxiety, and every time one problem fades even slightly, a new one immediately appears. My mind never rests; I am constantly in a state of anxiety. But what I am about to say does not excuse me in any way. I may be the most disgusting and horrible person. I myself feel repulsed by who I am.

I will start by saying that I cannot justify myself. I was 13–14 years old. I was exposed to sexual topics very early, but until the age of 15–16 I had never watched pornography, and I am afraid that this partially influenced my actions (in the sense that it might have been better if I had seen things rather than trying to understand what it was like on my own). When I was 10 years old, my cousin explained all of these things to me in great detail; before that, I had no knowledge of them at all.

Then, at that same age, my older brother began puberty. I do not blame him for anything. He began, so to speak, touching me and calling me to play some kind of game with him on the bed, something like doctor and patient. He was 13 at the time. But I was not traumatized, because in our relationship there were always strictly brotherly and sisterly feelings, and I understand that he was simply curious about how all of this worked. We have completely normal sibling relationships: we annoy each other, joke, fight, gossip, and we have never raised this topic. I think it would simply be awkward, especially for him. For me, it does not matter at all — it did not traumatize me.

Then, from the age of 13, my cousin (male) began touching me everywhere through my clothes. I thought he was doing this because he was in love with me, and unfortunately I fell in love with him. In my country, this was considered normal up to a certain point, although in my family it is viewed very negatively. Recently, I discussed all of this with another cousin (female). We talked everything through, and I fully realized that he touched me for the same reason my own brother did (and the same reason I myself did — I did not touch, but I kissed once). However, my own brother never touched me in the same way my cousin did. They were simply children.

In our country, the topic of sex is not discussed with parents, and such things are not talked about. At present, I do not hold any resentment toward anyone, and I stopped loving my cousin when I realized that his actions were simply adolescent interest (and I realized that it was not normal), curiosity, and hormones. But I am no better than he is. After everything that happened, I continued to love him for a very long time — another 4–5 years. I stopped loving him only recently. I am now 18 years old.

But I cannot forget what I myself did when I was 13–14. I have a younger brother; he has autism. I love him more than anyone in the world. I spend all of my money on him, and all of my free time with him, because my family is not very tolerant of spending time with him, as he constantly repeats the same things, often screams, cries, and hits (not out of malice). But I am used to it. I decided to devote my life to him, not because of what happened, but because he is the one who helps me live and helps me not to end everything right now. Because if I die, he will say that I left and abandoned him, and I cannot do that to him.

But unfortunately, once I did the most horrible thing to him. It seems that for some time I completely forgot about the nightmare I committed, for several years, because I was probably terrified by what I had done myself. He is six years younger than me. When I was 13–14 years old, I do not remember exactly when — perhaps I was already 14 — I had a very high libido, and I was extremely curious about what it felt like to kiss. At that time, I could not watch pornography; I did not know how. And the only person with whom I could do what I wanted was him (not in a sexual sense).

I told him that we should kiss. It was probably an adult-type kiss, and it lasted about 10–20 seconds. I immediately realized that I had made a huge mistake. And I believe I asked him to kiss my earlobe, because my sister had said that it feels pleasant (we did nothing beyond that; I was simply curious, and unfortunately there was no one else around at that moment except him). After that, nothing like this ever happened again. I would never do anything like that again. I never repeated it. I do not know how I could have done this to him — he was small, and he did not understand anything at all.

I do not know how to live with this. I do not think he remembers it, because he barely speaks. But what if he does remember it, and it affects him negatively? Although he is very attached to me. His development is approximately at the level of a 5–6-year-old. Now he is 11, and at that time he was 7–8. He simply does not understand what it is, but that does not justify me and does not make what happened any less terrible — on the contrary, it makes the situation much more complicated.

I do not know how I could have done this. It was horrible. I do not know how to live with this. You have probably noticed that I am very far from what could be considered normal. But when you are not normal and do not harm anyone, that can stillYou’ve probably noticed that I’m very far from being considered normal. When you’re not normal but you don’t harm anyone, that might still be acceptable, but what I did—I don’t know how I could have done that to the most important person in my life, how I could have acted that way. At the same time, I want to say that in all other aspects of my life I am an absolutely normal and healthy person. People want to communicate with me, I read a lot, I study well, and I’m planning to start a relationship with my classmate soon.

But how can I live after what I did? How can I be worthy of life? How can I be an ordinary person after what I did to him? I have no one I can tell this to. I’m afraid of disappointing everyone. I’m afraid my parents will stop trusting me and will be afraid that I might do something wrong. But he is my younger brother. I don’t know how I could have done this to him, even though I always loved him more than anyone, as my most beloved younger brother.

I want to say that I grew up in Central Asia and I live here. What do you think I should do? How should I continue living? What should I do for my brother? I never did anything like that again after that incident; I understood everything immediately. I cry every day now and don’t know how to keep living. I wasn’t some small child who could at least slightly justify herself. What do you think I should do? I’m sorry for saying all this; I don’t know where to turn.

My life has now turned into hell, but I deserve it. I regret it, and if there is one thing in this life I would want to change, it would be this. I hope my brother will forgive me; I don’t deserve him. Tell me, what should I do? What should I do for my brother? Do you think I’m ill?

But what I am about to say does not excuse me in any way. I may be the most disgusting and horrible person. I myself feel repulsed by who I am.

I will start by saying that I cannot justify myself. I was 13–14 years old. I was exposed to sexual topics very early, but until the age of 15–16 I had never watched pornography, and I am afraid that this partially influenced my actions (in the sense that it might have been better if I had seen things rather than trying to understand what it was like on my own). When I was 10 years old, my cousin explained all of these things to me in great detail; before that, I had no knowledge of them at all.

Then, at that same age, my older brother began puberty. I do not blame him for anything. He began, so to speak, touching me and calling me to play some kind of game with him on the bed, something like doctor and patient. He was 13 at the time. But I was not traumatized, because in our relationship there were always strictly brotherly and sisterly feelings, and I understand that he was simply curious about how all of this worked. We have completely normal sibling relationships: we annoy each other, joke, fight, gossip, and we have never raised this topic. I think it would simply be awkward, especially for him. For me, it does not matter at all — it did not traumatize me.

Then, from the age of 13, my cousin (male) began touching me everywhere through my clothes. I thought he was doing this because he was in love with me, and unfortunately I fell in love with him. In my country, this was considered normal up to a certain point, although in my family it is viewed very negatively. Recently, I discussed all of this with another cousin (female). We talked everything through, and I fully realized that he touched me for the same reason my own brother did (and the same reason I myself did — I did not touch, but I kissed once). However, my own brother never touched me in the same way my cousin did. They were simply children.

In our country, the topic of sex is not discussed with parents, and such things are not talked about. At present, I do not hold any resentment toward anyone, and I stopped loving my cousin when I realized that his actions were simply adolescent interest (and I realized that it was not normal), curiosity, and hormones. But I am no better than he is. After everything that happened, I continued to love him for a very long time — another 4–5 years. I stopped loving him only recently. I am now 18 years old.

But I cannot forget what I myself did when I was 13–14. I have a younger brother; he has autism. I love him more than anyone in the world. I spend all of my money on him, and all of my free time with him, because my family is not very tolerant of spending time with him, as he constantly repeats the same things, often screams, cries, and hits (not out of malice). But I am used to it. I decided to devote my life to him, not because of what happened, but because he is the one who helps me live and helps me not to end everything right now. Because if I die, he will say that I left and abandoned him, and I cannot do that to him.

But unfortunately, once I did the most horrible thing to him. It seems that for some time I completely forgot about the nightmare I committed, for several years, because I was probably terrified by what I had done myself. He is six years younger than me. When I was 13–14 years old, I do not remember exactly when — perhaps I was already 14 — I had a very high libido, and I was extremely curious about what it felt like to kiss. At that time, I could not watch pornography; I did not know how. And the only person with whom I could do what I wanted was him (not in a sexual sense).

I told him that we should kiss. It was probably an adult-type kiss, and it lasted about 10–20 seconds. I immediately realized that I had made a huge mistake. And I believe I asked him to kiss my earlobe, because my sister had said that it feels pleasant (we did nothing beyond that; I was simply curious, and unfortunately there was no one else around at that moment except him). After that, nothing like this ever happened again. I would never do anything like that again. I never repeated it. I do not know how I could have done this to him — he was small, and he did not understand anything at all.

I do not know how to live with this. I do not think he remembers it, because he barely speaks. But what if he does remember it, and it affects him negatively? Although he is very attached to me. His development is approximately at the level of a 5–6-year-old. Now he is 11, and at that time he was 7–8. He simply does not understand what it is, but that does not justify me and does not make what happened any less terrible — on the contrary, it makes the situation much more complicated.

I do not know how I could have done this. It was horrible. I do not know how to live with this. You have probably noticed that I am very far from what could be considered normal. But when you are not normal and do not harm anyone, that can stillYou’ve probably noticed that I’m very far from being considered normal. When you’re not normal but you don’t harm anyone, that might still be acceptable, but what I did—I don’t know how I could have done that to the most important person in my life, how I could have acted that way. At the same time, I want to say that in all other aspects of my life I am an absolutely normal and healthy person. People want to communicate with me, I read a lot, I study well, and I’m planning to start a relationship with my classmate soon.

But how can I live after what I did? How can I be worthy of life? How can I be an ordinary person after what I did to him? I have no one I can tell this to. I’m afraid of disappointing everyone. I’m afraid my parents will stop trusting me and will be afraid that I might do something wrong. But he is my younger brother. I don’t know how I could have done this to him, even though I always loved him more than anyone, as my most beloved younger brother.

I want to say that I grew up in Central Asia and I live here. What do you think I should do? How should I continue living? What should I do for my brother? I never did anything like that again after that incident; I understood everything immediately. I cry every day now and don’t know how to keep living. I wasn’t some small child who could at least slightly justify herself. What do you think I should do? I’m sorry for saying all this; I don’t know where to turn.

My life has now turned into hell, but I deserve it. I regret it, and if there is one thing in this life I would want to change, it would be this. I hope my brother will forgive me; I don’t deserve him. Tell me, what should I do? What should I do for my brother? Do you think I’m ill? Maybe I have some illness or a psychological disorder?",1,2,2025-12-15 22:01:47,,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pnbtxl/help/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,0.9868,0.03640945454545457,-0.894534170627594,1,-0.1439451944047061,0
1pn5d1f,My acquaintance didn't reach out to my message I sent in almost 3 weeks,"This is quite a long story but I'm adding the context to understand my perspective. So for all my life I have struggled with friendships due to a multitude of factors including childhood trauma, being into the wrong friend groups etc. 

I grew up being isolated from social interaction and not finding a secure friend group. I am currently in my healing stage and I come to realise that I am the problem. I get a bit clingy when someone is interested in me and have high expectations on myself and others. I constantly think of how to make others like me which led me to lack boundaries, people pleasing, oversharing etc. Fortunately, I was able therapy and worked through these issues and my therapst suggested that i should attempt to meet new people and keep in mind of struggles so that I can make better choices. 

So, I met a person from the bookstore in May this year and we happened to chat alot in the first encounter. We followed each other on ig and have been talking since. We would react to each other stories (most being political and personal). They (this person is non-binary) mentioned that they are autistic do they have trouble communicating which I was very compassionate about and laid off a bit. So in August, we have seen each other abit a few times this year so I decided to ask them if we could build a friendship but in a slow pace starting at acquaintance level. They responded that they had to think about it bc they are unsure and I respected their decision. They came back to me 5 minutes later saying they would love to build a friendship but apologised for the uncertainty as they were autistic. About a month later, I asked if they went to hang out in September or October but they didn't respond but view my posts (this was when the whole Charlie Kirk passing debate was going on) and I asked if everything was okay. They said they were busy at the time but we could hang out in the beginning of October. So I gave them their space and I got back them in early October saying I also have commitments and suggested if we could move it to mid October or some other month. They didn't respond but they liked and viewed alot of my stories.

1pmy3uw,Feeling like my therapist doesn't want me as a client.,"I've been in therapy with the same provider for nearly three years now. It's been tremendously helpful in a variety of ways. Recently, I had a session and it went well as usual but what happened once the session ended is leaving me disheartened. As it ended I paid for the session and she said I was all set. I looked at her with a blank stare cause we always setup the next appointment before I pay. She quickly realized we had yet to schedule and said ""you want to schedule next visit?"". The issue is she said it in sort of exhausted or unenthused tone. She said it like she was dreading scheduling another session which leaves me to wonder if she intentionally wanted me to leave without scheduling an appointment. 

What makes the situation more bothersome is this isn't the first time this has happened. There were two other instances several months ago where at the end of the session she seemed like she didn't want me to come back. Again, begrudgingly setting up the next visit. Also, when I left last visit I was reminded of another instance that happened over the summer. I was having car issues and had to request we do the session virtually which she agreed. Like always that session went well but at the end I asked ""so next time will be back in person right?"" then she said ""sure if you can make it, I know you like to come by"". After she said that she said something else. I'm not sure if I was hearing her correctly but it sounded like she said ""I don't like it when you come by"". For months I've been thinking she didn't really say that but now I'm starting to think she did. In all of the instances I was left stuck not knowing how to respond so I just proceeded the same way I normally do pretending like I wasn't completely thrown off. 

Today I discussed this with a clinician I know personally and he suggested I text or email my therapist to see if we can have a brief phone conversation. Me and my therapist have discussed advocating for myself and having uncomfortable conversations. This is definitely a situation where I need to be proactive. The problem is I'm unsure if this the correct way to go. Like, I can't imagine a scenario where this doesn't go south. A. she's honest and tells me what's wrong with me or what I'm doing to make her not want to see me. B. she gaslights me and say I'm being paranoid and misinterpreting things. C. she takes the easy way out and says we're no longer a good fit or she's not equipped to deal with me. Either way I  run risk of losing my therapist. If I get terminated because of this I will probably never do therapy again. I've shared so much this therapist, things I never share with anyone in real life. At the same time I really want to know what's going on. If anyone needs more context I'll be happy to provide more",5,5,2025-12-15 09:41:06,napsack340,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pmy3uw/feeling_like_my_therapist_doesnt_want_me_as_a/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,0.9456,0.11690476190476191,0.7500264048576355,-1,0.6820741548097702,1
1pmye29,I’m not sure what to do:," So I have been going to Therapy for a while, originally to help myself become a better person for my future partner and me.

 I’ve been having an especially hard time with my partner, it feels like I upset them constantly. I get they aren’t perfect, nor are they able to get the mental help that they need and want. Lately they have been saying some especially heinous shit to me and I am trying so hard not to take it more personally than I already have. 

 I started marking myself again on the arm with a knife, it feels like relief in some ways especially when I am upset and angry either at myself or if I an just an accessory. I try very hard to make my partner feel appreciated but the last weekend really got to me. 

 I clean up a good deal of the house, do dishes, process and fold laundry, make their bed and try to pick things off the floor so their room does not feel overwhelming or suffocating after a long day. Started evening making her breakfast too, after walking the dog after I finish a 12HR Overnight Shift so she has a good start to the day. I don’t move mountains, I’m not trying to make myself look like a saint as I am far from it. But I do try my best for my Lover. 

 I got tasked with taping up the kitchen, so we can paint it over before the new fridge we had came. By no means am I a professional contractor, nor am I inexperienced. But for six hours of getting painstaking angles and such. They break down crying, that I did a piss poor job of it despite I ran out of tape and made me feel like I couldn’t do anything. 

“I asked you to do one thing…”

“You don’t get why I am upset, it’s not the tape.” (It was remarked I “Half-assed” it several times.)

Otherwise I felt like crap, it was demoralizing and felt like I wasted my time at this point. After she went to her room to cool off, comes back downstairs since I start painting since no one else was gonna do it. Tried to have a conversation with me, while reasonably balanced had said: 

“You do all these great things for others, go above and beyond. But I feel like I am on the back burner of your mind and don’t matter. You don’t put in the effort.” After hearing that, I heard a string snap in my head and was shaking a bit. I wanted to cry, scream but instead went for a walk in the cold. I didn’t want to feel a goddamn thing, good that it was negative windchill that it was already. 

One week later, into this Sunday I try to have a group hug with their Mother and Her before she goes off. Sometimes she says “Don’t talk/hug my Mom” jokingly and I guess this time was serious due to overstimulation. I backed off the second “No, stop” and then get jabbed in the gut and told “I asked you three times to stop” Because the Doggo wanted to join. 

 This part was in front of one of her friends, which felt embarrassing and was already mocked a fair bit as soon as I got home. Being told how to do my job that I trained for, my masculinity in several ways, called rude terms for looking in the brand new fridge before she could show me the new layout. But what hurts me the most?

 She would never do any of this to their friends if they did something a bunch of mistakes. I am struggling not to cut my arms up any further, it’s starting to feel like naturally biting my fingers whenever I mess up. I know it’s wrong, nor do I have the heart to tell my therapist. I don’t want to jeopardize my job. 

 How do I deal with this? I don’t want to become a monster to the person who I closed on a house with.

1pmyfqr,Fact checking- does self awareness lead to a parent breaking their own generational trauma naturally?,"I’ve never gone to therapy. I’m understanding the importance and how someone like me could really benefit from it, but my own anxieties get in the way. 

But talking does help. Somehow I started exploring myself using ChatGPT (it felt safe to not be talking to a real human). It started off with me trying to understand the meltdowns my daughter was suddenly Happening.

Anyways, ChatGPT is 100% certain she is hsp. ChatGBT is also certain that I am also.
I had a terribly upbringing. It was very supervised and controlled. It was violent when I didn’t behave or do the “right thing.” No one comforted me. I had to self soothe. Chatgbt says that I developed my own “internal therapist” as a way to survive. This is apparently why I’m so self aware. 

I want to explore this deeper. Is this a real thing? Chatgbt is suggesting that this is why I have naturally broken generational trauma (it’s true, I have not parented in the same way my parents did, in fact they mock me on my gentle approach) 

But then I learnt that most people do this unconsciously. And you need to be self aware or go to therapy to break this pattern?

My husband mimics how his dad, was to him. He goes to work, and avoids other responsibilities, and is vacant to our girls.. My dad mimicked how his father parented (abuse, violence, very authoritarian) onto me. Even my mother did alot of abuse (not heavy) but I recognise it as harmful to me but  a coping mechanism for her. I don’t blame her. I just recognise it and know it was harmful, and to not repeat it.

Do most people subconsciously parent the way their parents did. Because I honestly didn’t realise this. I thought everyone recognised where their parents screwed up and know the hurt and pain associated . I thought everyone knew not to repeat it.

1pmtiw3,Why is it i’m always told to lower my expectations with others when I don’t feel I should have to?,"I’ve noticed this pattern in my life with my relationships, and maybe it’s because of how I was raised because I feel I need to lower expectations with everyone in my life besides my family.

With my in laws, I’ve had to drastically lower my expectations, with their emotional intelligence, empathy, basically in any relationship with them, I need to take my expectations of how they should be and lower them by 70%. I cannot expect them to reach out after tragedy, not ask for a favor after a tragedy, make plans more than a week in advanced, even for holidays, and then we get bashed for not being able to attend.

With friends, even best friends, they’ve hurt me in the past, some things I struggle to get past. Like being left out of plans, being considered annoying because I want concrete plans or made ahead plans, being told “next time we go we’ll let you know!” and then I hear nothing, and they tell me about the plans like there’s nothing wrong. I’ve been told by my therapist as well I just need to lower my expectations with them if I want to avoid being hurt.

Even trying to make new friends, I get ghosted. It’s impossible to make new friends lately, and it’s just me and my husband now. Again, i’ve been told to just lower my expectations with trying to make new friends because people usually aren’t as reliable or relatable.

Why is this such a common thing and can it be fixed? I feel my expectations are where they are at to keep people in my life, but why is it so hard to find others that meet the bare minimum of expectations for a basic friendship or relationship?

1pmkegl,"""You seem to have a lot to nitpick about every social interaction you encounter""","This title is quoted from a recent observation from my therapist in my last session, who I feel is starting to become more than a therapist. 

I have been therapist shopping for 5 years now, changing almost every year. The issues that I bring into the therapy room mostly revolve around my feeling of loneliness, body image and grief. At the start of this year, after feeling my previous therapist was too methodical to the point that I don't feel connected with her, I sought for another that was a bit more natural in approach and personality. 

At first meeting, her presence and demeanor were exuding empathy and warmth. At that moment, I felt like I finally got someone who I was looking for - a therapist that I can connect with easier and process my stuff with. Her compassion was so enlightening to the point that she would offer a tight hug every time after the session ended, which I know is overstepping professional boundaries but I allowed it. This connection was probably amplified by being aware of the fact that both of us came from the same hometown state.

However, after a few sessions, something starts to feel off. I noticed whenever I bring in my grievances and stories, she chose to reply not just with empathy but also reminding me of how social reality is. Sometimes, her facts are thrown with some blends of her own life stories. At first, I accepted her self-disclosures probably as a function of wanting to connect, but the manner that she responded to my stories nowadays have made it felt that I'm talking to an aunty more than a therapist. It feels pushy, and she explicitly imply me to change my expectations towards others (disclosure: the expectation that I could not get fulfilled all the time is someone who I care taking the initiative to check-in on me) (Her response that is still stuck in my head: ""You know that expectations are all but an illusion?"").

I know for a fact that I can call her out on this and was also advised to do so by my therapist friend (btw, I'm also a therapist). Yet, when she pointed out that observation that I used as the title here, I started to question if I am again repeating the cycle of nitpicking and finding criticism that would be more detrimental to my therapeutic process. Another thing she reminded me that kept me in my place was also that she mentioned how rushing progress in therapy is not going to work since 90% of the work has to be carried by the client.

As I'm writing this, I am starting to physically feel suffocated with self-doubt, thinking that my stuck progress with my healing being my own doing and I should just accept what I'm offered. And to take the hopeless social reality my therapist reminded me as something that I should simply adjust my lifestyle to, albeit triggering my helplessness and call to painfully abandon my extroverted self.

Honestly, with all these years and all the shit that I have went through, I really didn't want the ONE space that I thought I can reliably count on for healing and recuperation to be this tough for me to handle. I just can't help but understand her words, in parallel with words of my emotionally neglectful parents, as it is my own doing that led me to all of my grievances and negative stuff.

1pmyjlw,too depressed to work,"slight exaggeration, but I don't know what to do. I'm 16, and am currently working at my second job. I quit my first job because my family was in the process of moving and I was also trying to keep up with school, which I already struggled with since COVID. I now work at the same place as my older sister and I have since late August. I've tried so hard to keep going but I don't know what to do anymore. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since 2021, and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder since I think 2023. I am also on medication for high blood pressure from my anxiety and adhd symptoms/traits. I get overwhelmed/overstimulated really easily, to the point of crying or being close to tears at work or in public. I struggle with focusing and motivation, especially with school work, so I am often very behind on homework. 

Because of all of this, I very often experience periods of continuous, almost daily major depressive episodes. when I get these episodes, I can barely do any more than the bare minimum of what my body needs. I don't know if I, in the current state of my mental health, can work. I work so I can have my own money, as well as help with bills and groceries. I don't know if I can just *not* have that extra money. 

I really don't know what to do. frankly, I'm leaning towards taking a break from being employed until I'm in better health mentally, but I really don't know.

1pmqkrd,Question ocd??,"Question ocd I need help

Hello everyone, I wanted to ask about what I’m going through.

First, I have been diagnosed with depression, depersonalization/derealization, and existential OCD (or existential anxiety).

What I experience is not just thoughts. These are the things that happen:

1. Every person, place, or anything I was living my life around while I had intrusive thoughts  when I see it now, I automatically remember the thoughts and feel sad again. I live like this all day long.

2. All day I have intense thoughts about how beautiful life was without these thoughts, how I would act, live, feel situations, and experience emotions if these thoughts didn’t exist. My life before the thoughts feels like it was open in front of me, and my mind keeps showing me the difference all day long.

3. Before every thought or feeling appears, the moment it comes, I feel like I’m thinking the wrong way and feeling the wrong way  even though I know that thoughts and feelings are automatic. It feels as if I am inventing new thoughts and feelings by myself, and that there is a “correct” way to think and feel, and I am thinking and feeling incorrectly.

5. I have learned to recognize intrusive thoughts, but my mind always tells me that maybe the thoughts I am doing exposure with and ignoring are not actually intrusive.

6. I constantly and excessively envy people who don’t have my thoughts and who live with values and principles they follow. I feel like I have lost everything. I envy how they know how to take a stance and live their lives, while I no longer have that.

Whenever I care about anything, my mind immediately starts saying: “Don’t care. We’re going to die. Nothing is real. You’re exhausting yourself for nothing.”

It feels like living inside a prison.

7. Even when I set things for myself to help reduce the thoughts, my mind starts telling me that I’m using them the wrong way, and that there is a specific program I must follow  even if what I set for myself is actually helping me.

8. My mind keeps reminding me all day of the headache caused by these thoughts. I am suffering

Are these obsessive thoughts?

Is it normal to be tortured by these thoughts all day long",3,2,2025-12-15 03:41:53,No_Customer6938,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pmqkrd/question_ocd/,therapy,1.0,Question,-0.9559,-0.019507575757575762,0.0,-1,-0.2906715151515151,-1
1pmxgva,Broken heart,"hi, I’ve never done this before so I made a throw away account. my sister and I are having some problems and I don’t know what to do and need some advice (also a place to vent). so for context there’s a 6 year age gap and we live in a good community and have a good home life (This is just background).

my parents have kinda spoiled her to the point where she didn’t graduate high school, ran away multiple times to hang out with sketch people and kinda is a bad kid even though I hate calling her that. my parents have given her every resource to help and she doesn’t use any of it or want any of it. It’s like she’s happy being with this life that revolves around drugs and partying. She has ADHD and my dad uses that as an excuse for every bad thing she’s done (even when she drunk drove a stolen car and cashed at 200km and almost killed her friends, this will also cost my parents significantly)

Well when I was in high school I was assaulted very publicly by L. he really messed up my life for a while and it got to the point where I transferred schools from the harassment afterwards. my sister saw all of it (not the actual assault but what it did to me and the aftermath, think pysc ward bad). I dont want to go into full details but it was bad and known. Well when my sister was in her final year of high school she met L’s sister and became friends with her. The moment I found out that was L’s sister (which was very early on, I don’t think my sister even met him yet), I told my sister everything so that she could be safe.

My sister instead went out of her way to be his friend (him and his sister aren’t even close which makes it weird too). At one point when she came home drunk she actually told me that it was so long ago it didn’t count and that I made it worse then what he said (looking back I know I’m dumb for not putting it together then, think willful ignorance)She then started sleeping with him and that turned into a full relationship. his sister then messaged me telling me about this at the beginning of summer (I know what she said was true cause my sister admitted everything to me after) and I lost it because that’s where she had been skipping school, doing drugs, and leaving home for (I’m talking sometimes weeks at a time without even telling my parents she’s okay). I also found out that she and him have talked about my weight (I’ve gained some since high school), about how I’m a bitch and all this other stuff.

I didn’t talk to her for a month after that until she came crying saying they were over and she missed me. i forgave her and told her how much she hurt me. I found out at the beginning of this month that them being split up didn’t last more then 3 weeks… that’s months of her lying again because I directly asked her more then once. I also found out because another family member who my sister talks to a lot told me how much she was talking about him (she didn’t know the details or who he was). Ive told my parents and they don’t care and think it’s fine as long as he isn’t in the house (my sister already has snuck him in when I wasn’t home and they didn’t realize who he was but still, they would know now though so I don’t see that happening again).

I’ve told my boyfriend and he has been a great support. i haven’t told anyone else in the family. I asked her if she could wait till after christmas till she saw him again so that the holidays would be good but she’s literally going on dates with him and still is seeing him and isn’t even attempting to hide it now. it’s almost worse then before, today she offered me food from their date??? Christmas is coming and i honestly want to die. idk therapy is expensive so that’s why im here. How does someone even handle something like this? I would love to just like block her and be done but i still live with my family so I’m just stuck For now, I know in the future I will never be able to be around her but how do I make this time better and less painful?",0,0,2025-12-15 09:07:45,Different-Maize-9755,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pmxgva/broken_heart/,therapy,0.5,Advice Wanted,-0.3352,0.054780844155844166,0.0,-1,-0.08960383116883117,0
1pmnj36,"Does anyone else use ""the exit"" as a constant backup plan?","I don’t even know when it started but it’s been there forever. I remember being in 8th grade and I might have written a note in the back of my school notebook saying if things didn’t work out I’d just off myself. My teacher found it somehow because I had forgotten totally that I had written something like that and literally she just scolded me for ""writing that on school work."" Like... she completely ignored that a 13 yr old was saying that and just cared about the notebook. lol.

But since then, it’s basically my default. Every time I'm in a bad spot, my first instinct isn't to fix it, it's just ""well if this fails i'll just end it."". 

I’ve even tried a few times once got really sick, other times I backed out last second bc it didn't feel serious enough yet.

Also I’ve set a deadline now lol. If my life isn’t fixed by 2030, that’s it. By then I’ll figure out a way that doesn't hurt. I told a friend and he thinks it’s super problematic but honestly it's just part of my life now. It’s comforting to know I have a fallback if nothing works out.

1pmvomo,Help navigating through mother in law situation before it turns too toxic.,"My husband (36M) and I (33F) live in the US. We are of Indian origin and been in the US for about 8 years. Both our parents live in India. His mother calls him at-least twice a day, every day. The frequency isn’t the main issue - the *dynamic* is.

In 3 years of marriage, my MIL has never once called me. She only calls my husband. Any interaction we’ve had is because I called her or she returned my missed call.

When she speaks to him, she talks as if he lives alone and is unmarried. Even when I’m sitting right next to him, she says things like “*you* go eat,” “*you* travel,” “*you* take care of *yourself*,” “*you* should try this recipe”,”*you* have fun with friends"" and never acknowledges my presence, never acknowledges that he has a wife. (I am only citing small everyday examples). She never asks for me.

When my husband was sick, she told *him* to make tea, massage and oil his own head, etc., without ever acknowledging that his wife could help. She also routinely contradicts me in real time if I suggest something while he’s on the call - she immediately suggests the opposite.

My husband is kind, loves me but is conflict-avoidant and hasn’t set boundaries.

I shared this with AI therapy / online therapy tools, and this is the analysis I received:

* My mother-in-law is relating to my husband as if he is her **primary emotional partner (surrogate husband)**, not as a married adult with a wife.
* By speaking only to him, she is **symbolically erasing me**, even when I’m physically present.
* Excluding me during illness reinforces the message: *“You don’t need your wife; you need me.”*
* Contradicting me in real time is a **power move**, not coincidence - it asserts dominance and undermines my role.

Need advice on how to navigate through this situation.

Also some background -

1. He is not a single child
2. I’ve never ill treated my in-laws. In the past, they've stayed with us for months with no complaints. I always speak to them with love and respect. We've traveled together to multiple cities/countries. I'm a no drama person. So I don't want to end up with “this is normal, and should adjust” responses.

So, I’m a woman, 26y. 

In the last few weeks I’ve been feeling down and frustrated. Life is feeling to heavy and serious. 

Work, responsibilities, making decisions…

I miss the spontaneity my life used to have. I miss feeling light. (If that makes sense) 

I do therapy since I was 20y. And although I love it and I’m grateful for it, I feel like it has been inhibiting  me from experiencing stuff. 

I always ask myself before making a decision “is this something I would be proud to tell my therapist?” And then I make the right decision based on that.

Results? Life’s been more boring than ever.

I miss randomly texting an ex boyfriend.

I miss having sex with a stupid guy and regret it later.

I miss going out thinking I have nothing to lose (except some brain cells)

I don’t know. I miss substance in life. I miss adventure. I miss the unknown.

I don’t know how else to explain this.

For a long time I couldnt fall in love until about 2 months ago. But thats when I noticed that I suddenly didn‘t feel good enough again..all the doubts i had in my past relationship came crawling back. ,,Am I good enough? Who would want someone like me?“ and I got the urge to completely change up again. New clothes, new make up, sort out my space, I needed to feel perfect in order to feel worthy. And I know that this is impossible and contradicts all the work i have put into myself. 

I just don‘t know how to get rid of this feeling of needing to be ‚perfect‘ to even be worthy of love or a boyfriend. It holds me back from meeting & letting in new people in my live because i get so scared they are gonna leave me. Tbf my ex really shattered me as a whole, i went numb for a year after. He hid me, he wouldnt wanna be seen with me in public, he always wanted me to go to the gym..i always felt like i wasnt good enough or he was ashamed of me.

How can I work through this? I thought I was doing so well. :(

1pmlbxu,Should I switch therapists?,"I’ve been with this therapist for a year and a half now. It seems like we’re talking about the same things over and over but I don’t feel like anything is actually changing. We’ve identified major problem behaviors such as oversharing, over apologizing, and overeating (which I already knew before starting therapy) but we’ve done nothing active to work on my self esteem or on changing these behaviors. I overshare because I ruminate and obsessively think about things but her advice is to “go for a walk” and leave the environment but with an obsessive mind this doesn’t tend to do much because my emotions and thoughts are growing regardless.

She practices DBT skills but I never felt like I had a personalized practice of DBT, she says we discussed skills but I don’t think that’s true…. She made me join a DBT skills group she was cohosting but we never discussed them in our sessions… my frustration is growing. We’re also not addressing my attachment issues that clearly manifest with her, I’m unable to walk away from her despite her values deeply clashing with mine and triggering me so much. She on the other hand seemed so eager to drop me when I would try to discuss this, she’d tell me she can refer me out and seemed like she couldn’t care less about me, especially when her schedule became full and she started having a waitlist to her name. I’m just so hurt and at this point it feels like she is just using me for financial gains instead of helping me work on improving. Is this what therapy is? Just becoming “aware” of things? I already am very self aware. When I asked her for more step by step actions she would tell me that I just needed to “stop” oversharing and the problematic behaviors. If it were that easy why would I be in therapy right?

1pmdi5w,"not really serious, but did I do the right thing?","a few days ago, i (17F) broke my classmate's (17M) glasses by accident. i got a little annoyed with him and just wanted to play around a little but accidentally swiped the glasses off his head instead, my heart dropped. but what scared me more at the time was when he nearly shot a chair at me — side note: he has anger issues, lately though, he's gotten better. i was terrified, to the point i cried half a bucket which i was surprised with because i seldomly cry. the teacher allowed us to make amends but the first problem that crossed my mind was paying for the glasses, which was ₱4000 and didn't have a problem with because i have already saved some. the only problem i was sweating bullets about was getting adults involved, especially my mother or my grandparents. i really, really didn't want my mother to be burdened by the payment or having my grandparents think i'm really as stupid as they probably think, so i lied and didn't tell them. 

the next day, my classmate's grandmother and mother visited me, asking me if I was capable of paying them the cost of his glasses, i agreed but i also requested to keep this between him and me, so i wouldn't get my parents involved and explained that this was MY problem, MY mistake, and that noone should lift a finger over what I did. his mother didn't really buy it at first because she probably, likely, thought i was being selfish and that i was being unfair because she scolded his son for being careless with his things and that i get to leave unscathed. i explained again that this was my mess, only I get to fix it and she let me go. his grandmother was so sweet, we had a long talk, thinking about it now, i want to cry over the fact i'm making her do my request to keep the issue quiet between us and that she understands we were just being kids and still are as impulsive and prone to acting out. she was so considerate that it kinda made me internally rot, i thanked them and paid them, then i went home feeling like ""way to go, you're one demanding b**ch.""

i didn't tell my grandparents or my mother, told them that some classmates came over to discuss projects and let me slide, while also being internally eaten alive. 

idk anymore. for days now, i still think about what my classmate's mother told me about being incredibly unfair and the fact i made possibly the biggest lie in my life. i want to throw myself somewhere, never to be seen again. honestly, i feel like a martyr for even thinking that ""i'll just bring this pain and guilt around with me till i die, that's going to be my punishment: become paranoid."" is what i did even right❓was it selfisness or responsibility ❓",2,2,2025-12-14 18:30:14,MaleficentImage4951,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pmdi5w/not_really_serious_but_did_i_do_the_right_thing/,therapy,0.75,Advice Wanted,-0.9937,-0.05046296296296296,-0.8221535086631775,1,-0.7192793469241814,-1

1pm9fe5,How to stop going in reasoning circles,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit. I just want to know how to stop going in circles when I’m in a bad headspace. I often get stuck on the idea that I’m inherently worse than everyone on Earth and am not deserving of the same treatment. I devolve into believing I am not truly human, and am just a fake with all the same physical traits, but an essence that makes me inherently wrong. My main problem is the suffering Olympics. I believe I have not suffered enough to deserve help or empathy from others. Comparatively, my situation isn’t awful compared to those who were actually abused, but my reactions are still disproportionately big, imo. I know it’s not productive, I know it only makes me feel worse, but even when I acknowledge that it hurt me nonetheless, it makes me feel like I was born weak and don’t deserve to survive if I can’t handle a situation as simple as mine. It’s strained my relationship as well. I’ve had breakdowns where I beg her to break up with me because I believe I’ll ruin her life, and I get overly nervous when she complains about anything. It stresses her out that she can’t vent to me without stepping on egg shells. And I’m aware of this, and hate myself for it. But the more I hate myself, the worse it gets for her. Do you see my problem? I just don’t know how to change my mindset at this point.

1pm4bg0,My Transference is my mother!,"
I have some childhood neglect issues. 

I have had transference with my therapist for over a year now. I talked to her about it but she never really said much. At first I told her I had feelings for her.

A year later and lots of self-therapy I have realized that it's my mother. She has the qualities, kindness and compassion I always wanted in my mother. She is a mother herself and a really good mother. That connection is the transference of the emotions of my mother. 

I bursted out in tears and it was such a relief. Like I finally figured out why am the way I am with her. It's been so hard. The hardest thing I have ever done in my life. My therapist is a fairly new therapist when I first started and I don't think she has any experience with tranafernce. 

I just don't know what to do now to move on from it. I'll talk to my therapist but now what!

1pm2aev,Need Advice on the Type of Therapist I Should be Seeking,"Preface for the mods, I am not asking for a specific clinician and will not be including my location as per rule 7. 

Hello! I am using a burner account as I will be including some embarrassing information about myself here. 

Background:

I (30M) just had my birthday this week. Entering my 30’s has made me realize I want to start making some real change in my life, but I need a professional that can show me how I can make that a reality. 

I am unemployed, I live with my mother, and my room is.. well.. messy is an understatement. Over the last 20 years I have been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety. I have been treated via psychologist 10 separate times, with two of my therapists lasting multiple years.  ADHD has (assumingely) been my biggest issue and has led me to lose several jobs and land me a lot of debt. I have been medicated for ADHD, depression, and anxiety separately, and in tandem, throughout this 20 years. I have tried many different regimens and doses. 

I have two autoimmune diseases, celiac and psoriasis, which I’m coming to learn have affected my mental health more than I’d realized. I also have been diagnosed with sleep apnea which I have been in the process of treating for the last 3 years, so I am constantly fatigued. I am finally getting a dental device that will hopefully remedy this issue, CPAP did not work well for me at all.

Onto my question:

What kind of professional should I be seeking? 

All of the therapists I’ve seen over the last two decades were talk therapists that dealt with a wide variety of issues. Some dealt with trauma, others with anxiety and depression, I feel like I’ve seen a wide range of specializations in this field. Where I’ve always failed was when CBT and homework was introduced. It’s been a recurring theme that I’ll see a new therapist, start explaining my issues, then immediately receive a cookie cutter plan that I’ve seen countless times over. I’m sure this works for many people, and I will not sit here and diminish their efforts, but I have a history of these practices not working for me at all. 

I would like to hear some opinions from other ADHD folks here on what they view as a gold standard for treatment, or at least what has worked best.

Thanks if you made it this far! It’s not easy for me to share this much with strangers.

1pm6jb0,I’ve figured out some of the answers to my problems and I don’t know where to go from here,"Long story short, (F23) I’ve dealt with super severe anxiety and depression for 12 years now. I was in a very abusive relationship for 4 years as well. I’ve had just a lot happen, experienced lots of negativity. 

The past year, I’ve felt something has been missing from my life. 

I’m in a pretty happy and healthy relationship (3 years now). I lost all my friends due to fall outs, moves, & just busy adult lives. 

I have 2 jobs, 1 that I really love and the other, I’m struggling with, mentally but I don’t make nearly as much as I should be from both especially at my age. 

I don’t have the best relationship with my parents. They are pretty negative about a lot of things and we don’t share much in common, our relationship has just been straying further apart over the years. Long story short with this, they also talk horribly about me behind my back to my brother and act nothing of it. My brother and I are very close & always tells me everything. I have no clue why they do this. I brought it up once & my mom flipped out on me for finding out? Unsure why but it happened and that argument was not pleasant. 5 years later, this is still a thing.

My house is depressing. I feel so much negativity here. I shut down in there. Doesn’t help I have an active mold problem in my room that my parents say is not a big deal. When i’m out of the house, I feel free. I’m myself. It’s like i’m a whole different person but there’s nothing to do outside of my house either unless you drive 1-2hrs away, it’s a bit depressing too.

Anyway, I never traveled growing up and just a few months ago, my mom, boyfriend & I made a road trip states away to visit my grandma (my only grandparent). I even met up with an old friend too & I had the time of my life. Was there for 4 days but had the most fun I’ve had in I don’t know how long. This area had everything to do, I had a real friend there, I had my grandma, and I just fell in love with the area. I also despise the weather where I’m at now and this area, it’s perfect. I’ve already looked at jobs there and there’s so many opportunities and I feel I’d thrive. I’m still very unsure what I want to do with my career but I know I cannot figure it out here. Whatever it is, it’s not here. I know what I want & it’s to move. 

Here are the problems: 1. My boyfriend, who I genuinely love & we talk about marriage all the time, does not want to move at all. He’s very happy here as he has a perfect job for him & all of his family is here. I’ve talked about this all with him and he’s pretty against it. 2. Even though I don’t have a great relationship with my parents, I’m still pretty dependent on them. Might be a bit embarrassing to say but I definitely am. 3. I have zero money to do this. I can save up sure but I’m so serious, with the state i’m in, job wise, it’d take me literally YEARS to do so. The amount I make per week is embarrassing. As to living somewhere, I would stay with my grandma of course so some money is saved there but just in general, I seriously don’t have anything to work off of. 

And of course the other problems are finding a job, missing local things, and so much more. I just know that my current position right now is draining me and I need to do something about it now but I just can’t. I’m struggling so badly.

1pm1v4o,"Should I start looking for a new therapist, or am I overreacting to this?","TL;DR I’ve been with my therapist for almost four years and she helped me a lot early on, but I feel like I’ve outgrown working with her. She keeps focusing on issues I’ve already resolved and won’t fully engage with what I’m currently struggling with. When I asked for help managing anxiety about a break in my relationship, she spent much of the session talking about her own similar relationship that failed, compared my situation to it, and encouraged me to “prepare for the worst” instead of helping me with what I asked for, which only increased my anxiety. She also framed my current relationship as a repeat of my past one, even though I’m in a much healthier place now, and made dismissive, offensive comments about men that felt invalidating. I don’t want to end therapy impulsively after two bad sessions, but I’m starting to feel like she’s no longer a good fit for who I am now and I’m unsure what to do next.



I've been with my current therapist for almost *four years* now. For the first three and a half years, she was wonderful and helped me a lot, and I'm very grateful for that. I overcame a lot of anxiety, eating disorder issues, self-harm issues, substance abuse, etc. I'm doing extremely well with all this right now and have been for the past year. My first issue that arises is the fact that I just feel like I've outgrown working with her. I don't struggle with a lot of what I did back then, and the repetitive checking up on those things has gotten rather annoying and no matter how much I say I want to talk about something else that is pressing on me, she just won't let any of my past go. 

I went in last week with a bit of a relationship issue needing help, and came out utterly shocked at how it was handled. I went in just this morning wanting to talk more about the same thing, and I'm starting to find it infuriating. I won't explain in detail for the sake of brevity, but here's a summary:

Recently went on a break with my boyfriend so he could heal from some things and figure some stuff out. No issue with *that*, but I do have some anxiety about how it will look at the end of the break, fear of the unknown, etc. He told me we would do everything we can to make it work. I do believe he means that, but I struggle to trust that he will still feel that way at the end of the break (not because of him, he's genuinely a good guy) but because of my own anxiety and worry, ""what if he changes his mind?"" ""what if he doesn't mean what he said in a month?"" etc. 

I went into session last week asking for help on how to calm down those worries and anxious thoughts because I know I should trust him instead of worrying about things that have zero basis for belief. I asked for help on how to trust him even when I'm worried. She instead told me about the time her and her ex-boyfriend went through a very, very similar situation, and how it didn't work out because of XYZ, comparing her situation to mine, for over *half* of the session. I wasn't able to share everything because I had maybe ten minutes to say anything at all. 

Today, I went into session with her to talk about the same thing because I got little to no help last week. After getting another (shorter, at least) spiel about her realtionship that ended the same way, I asked again for help on how I can trust him instead of worrying myself over a bridge. She instead told me that I *shouldn't* just trust him, but that I should prepare for the worst just in case. Made me even more worried. She then proceeded to bring up my past relationship (which was over two years ago, I am very much over that) and she started pointing out what she called 'similarities' between the two. Yes, there's similarities in every relationship. But instead of listening to what I was telling her, she made it out to be me just repeating my actions of the last relationship, even though the circumstances are very, *very* different- and I'm not repeating anything at all. I'm doing much better than I did in that relationship. She wouldn't listen to how I was feeling, instead she *told* me how I was feeling and is trying to treat me as such. But I'm just not the person I was back then, I'm genuinely not repeating *anything*. 

She also has this ""men ain't shit"" mentality that I found really offensive, telling me ""You shouldn't be this upset or worried, he's just a man, you don't even know if you like him that much, it's only been x months, there's no reason to be this upset."" Mind you, this 'man' in question has been one of my best friends of *twelve years*. Yes, actually, I *am* sure I like him that much. She knows this as well.

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to terminate therapy with her over two sessions that upset me, but it's also the fact that I'd started feeling like I'd outgrown working with her before all this. I don't want to make any rash decisions from being upset or hurt, but I personally feel like she's just not a great fit for the person I've grown into. What's your thoughts?

1plwtv0,Trusting a therapist,"Am I overthinking when I say i’m scared of trusting a therapist?

It’s not like i’d be saying anything illegal but a big aspect of therapy is sharing about your personal life which is something i’m not really used to doing. Seriously I couldn’t even describe myself in an interview once, that’s how little I talk about myself to people.

Both being someone who has had secrets about them revealed and done it as well (not proud to admit) it just feels impossible to trust people these days

Obviously a therapist isn’t going to post about what their client said on social media/ who they are (I’d hope lol) but there’s always just something in the back of my head that refuses to trust people with my personal life.

For therapist: How do you manage to break down that wall to get your client to actually trust you? Does it take like a week or even months to years?

For those in therapy: How did you finally allow yourself to speak what’s on your mind and not just simplifying it to make it not sound as intense as it really is.",3,10,2025-12-14 03:11:34,uhhredacted,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1plwtv0/trusting_a_therapist/,therapy,1.0,Question,0.9772,-0.0689327485380117,-0.6474271416664124,1,-0.04434012054080855,0

1plvv5o,"I really need support, advice needed from a complex situation... low income family, wanting to move out","Hey everyone

For context, I'm a F in my 20s

Growing up, I've felt controlled about my whereabouts and choice of fashion. For every decision I want to choose, I feel judged for

I come from a country where the cost of living is very expensive. I plan to start university in September 2026, and I'm also currently not working due to horrible religious OCD I've struggled with that will result in tension headaches if I don't comply with whatever my brain tells me to do. It's extremely annoying and frustrating.

I don't have any friends, hardly leave the house, and don't have a phone. There are so many dresses and clothes I want to buy for myself, but barely have any space for them at home because I come from a low income family living in a 2 bedroom apartment. I also come from a large family and hardly have any personal space at home. I wish had friends to make positive memories with and look back on something in my life.

I don't think I've left the house this December at all. Last time I've left the house was probably around the ending of November

I don't want to feel as though I'm ""wasting"" my 20s away, and feel regretful down the line

I was considering on place myself into transitional housing to get personal space and finally feel free from home and just the constant judgement of every decision I make from my mom

I don't really have anyone to talk about this other than my siblings. I don't know what's best for me. I don't want to make regretful decisions

""I am 14 and i made a post about that on reddit some day ago, but to summarise my dog is being neglected (stays in a an approximately bathroom sized concrete kennel most if not all day, took more than a year to get another bath and only got his space cleaned because i told my parents to), the only thing that i think its done alright is feeding and water (and not even that i am fully sure).My parents refuse to rehome him. My therapist told me not to give him away and pretty much everyone else on reddit told me to take the responsability and take better care of him. But i really dont want it. I dont want to have a dog. I dont hate the dog but i hate having him. I already explained tons of times to my parents i want to rehome him but they dont want to. It feels like a burden. I dont want him here. I want him to be happy with someone else. You dont need to tell me that this is part of growing up and we cant have everything the way we like and sometimes we have to do hard and unpleasing stuff and its gonna be worth it for my dog. I already know all of it. And i am torn between thinking thats too much for me and thinking it was time for me to stop behaving like a toddler already and have something to be responsible for. 

I really just dont want the dog. I want him somewhere else and its hard to take care of a dog i dont enjoy being with.

But if there is anything else you have to say that could make it better i would appreciate it.""

I will just talk a little more about it. All of this is driving me crazy. I am the only person who recognizes his needs but i also dont want him here.

I was in a deeply abusive relationship for a long time, and it left me with a lot of trauma. Emotionally, mentally — I feel broken. My life feels completely derailed because of what I went through.

What hurts the most is that he left me so easily. As if everything we shared meant nothing. And yet, even after everything, I still find myself wanting to go back to him.

I don’t understand why I’m still waiting for him. Why I can’t move on. Why I still hope, even when it’s clear that it doesn’t seem to matter to him whether I’m okay, or even alive.

Logically, I know the relationship was harmful. I know I deserved better. But emotionally, I feel stuck. It’s like my mind understands, but my heart refuses to let go.

I’m struggling with guilt, confusion, and a deep sense of loss — not just of him, but of myself. I want to heal, but I don’t know how to break this attachment or why it feels so strong.

1plrpxb,MCT focused therapy and prolonged illness,"Hi :) So I recently started MCT focused therapy (I've had 5 sessions so far) and struggle to see the effects. For context, I am coming out of a period of prolonged illness which lasted about a year where I was basically bed bound. I find that I still frequently struggle with fatigue and symptoms even though i'm not as sick anymore. I feel that MCT works to a certain degree. It does help me avoid rumination and not letting the thought get ""too big"" if that makes sense. 

However when I am having flareups or feel fatigued, I struggle to not let it affect my thoughts and my mood around my physical health. I try to prolong the ruminating thoughts or to see these thoughts as neutral, but when my body is sending me physical symptoms it feels impossible to not be affected by them. After coming out of a flareup I struggle to get back to the MCT work I am doing, as I feel mentally fatigued from being in such a bad mental and physical state. I am just worried that this type of therapy isn't enough for me, as my ""situation"" feels more complex due to my physical struggles as well. 

I have tried to express this to my therapist, but she just ends up saying that my negative thoughts about my physical health and how it affects my life are just thoughts. And like I know she's right, but my health really affects my daily life and that makes these thoughts feel real. I guess I feel invalidated by her in a way but I don't know if that's just my brain resisting MCT. I guess i'm writing this because I need advice if I should continue this type of therapy or see if I can find another therapist. Btw English is not my native language so lmk if something isn't making sense.

Since then, I haven’t been able to find anyone that I feel comfortable with when it comes to therapy. I speak the language and everything but would prefer it to be in English since that’s what I’m used to, but I haven’t been able to find a place that actually offers it.

I’ve heard BetterHelp isn’t all that great, but if that’s the case, where \*can\* I find a good therapist online? I would appreciate it if there was also an option to find a trauma psychotherapist, since my previous therapist told me to try it out.

1plq2fw,Covert/vulnerable narcissism?,"Ever since I remember, I have had a problem with criticism. I was going to a very small school, in my class there were only 4 kids including me. I was a smart kid, learnt to read very early, writing as well, before going to school. My mom was praising me a lot in front of the people and then at school I didn’t have any problems with the material, didn’t have to study, was winning competitions and felt very good about myself. However, whenever things like drawing were the subject, and I wasn’t the best in the class, I was getting very frustrated. Even teachers were putting in my written grade feedback that I don’t deal well with failures. 

Other boys didn’t like me, I was different, they called me f*ggot and I didn’t know why, only later it turned out I’m actually gay. At the age of 11, I started watching porn. 

It’s worth adding that in puberty I started noticing some flaws in my appearance. My teeth were crooked and missing, I was born without some of them. Before I started growing rapidly, I was quite chubby. I remember my sister commenting once about my fat armpits, and I was just 9/10 years old. Later, I had problem with my voice for 2 years (couldn’t go through the changes in puberty smoothly and for 2 years I had a blockage in my mind stopping me from using the low voice). 
It finally stabilised at 14.

At 13, it was time to change the schools from my small primary school to a big secondary school in the city. In my class there were 32 students, almost as many as in the whole previous school. And I went to the best class, where most of kids were talented. I didn’t feel that special anymore, there were kids that were smarter and better than me, some were even successful both at sports and studying. I needed to hide my orientation throughout years, not feeling myself at home.

I was feeling worse and worse with my appearance and I was watching more and more porn. I was skinny. I was showing off online for adult men, selling my nude pictures, having cam shows. Over the years I also had Snapchat account and twitter account where I was posting my videos and photos publicly, hoping for attention and validation.

Now, I’m 26. In the last few years from skinny I got more manly but fatter. I hate my body. When I was skinny, it was considered attractive for big group of people, it was attracting comments in a positive way or at least ""oh my god you’re so skinny!!"". Now it’s different. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I hate any type of criticism, I get very defensive. I compare myself with others, even with my partner that was amazing. I feel not enough, I need constant validation from others. I look at men on the street and I want them to want me, to prove myself I am worthy something. 

Is it possible that due to being praised by mom in the childhood and then facing the reality in a bigger school that I’m not THAT special, I developed covert narcissism? My father was not very participating in my life, my mom had to force him to spend time with me. I slept with my mom to help myself fall asleep until 13 years old.

I am lost. I started therapy but I want to know if it makes sense at all.",1,0,2025-12-13 22:24:54,No-Surprise-4028,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1plq2fw/covertvulnerable_narcissism/,therapy,1.0,Question,0.9709,0.10404313785173158,0.0,1,0.31207862757034627,1
1plpxu3,Struggling to find a name for this cognitive tool I've used to help me live a happier life,"First off, I am not a therapist, psychologist, or expert in these areas, by any means. I'm an engineer with a fascination in psychology, mainly for the purposes of helping myself and others get through hard times.

Decades ago, I was stuck in a toxic cycle relationship. At a certain point I found myself completely exhausted, and realized this was either going to break me or I needed to break out, myself.

I came to the realization that I would never be able to change my partner, or control what they decided to say or do to me. All I had control over was my reaction and how I processed and internalized it. I began to realize I could replace my anger with empathy. While they had hurt me from time to time, they were living a life of conflict, constantly immersed within this life of turmoil. This made it easy for me to prevent my own emotional, hurt-filled reaction, as I would remind myself to find empathy instead of anger.

This revelation broke me free and I was able to move on, grow, and become stronger and more resilient.

Later on, I started to explore this idea of linked or paired negative/positive emotions. I had been employed, essentially in the same job, with the same company, for about 11 years. I wasn't seeing my career advance, and I realized it was due to me preferring comfort over growth.

I had mostly been letting fear control my choices, opting the safe, comfortable path. The paired emotions concept struck me again, and I realized I could replace fear with excitement, whenever I was asked to do something that pushed me outside of my comfort zone. I began to realize that fear, in the context of my career and job, was actually a sign of personal growth waiting, just on the other side. As I put this into practice, I watched my career advance and doors open for me that I never would have expected.

Recently, I have suffered many losses of loved ones and found myself saddled with grief and sadness. I dug back into this toolbox and found the positive paired emotions to sadness/grief were love/gratitude. I was sad because I loved and because I had been fortunate enough to have these wonderful individuals in my life. This allowed me to dig myself out of a deep hole of depression.

So my question to you is, is this concept of paired negative/positive emotions something that has been explored through research? Is this possibly a universal cognitive practice that could help others, or am I just fortunate to have stumbled upon something that seems to work positively for me?

Thanks in advance for any insight or references you’re willing to share.",1,0,2025-12-13 22:19:32,_ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1plpxu3/struggling_to_find_a_name_for_this_cognitive_tool/,therapy,1.0,Discussion,0.9333,0.12667748917748917,-0.49987271428108215,-1,0.05538914069495676,0
1plpuxh,I'm finally getting therapy and I'm scared,"Me and my partner got into a very ugly fight that almost resulted in a breakup about a month ago. The reason was fully on me, and in that moment of clarity when he went to work and I had time to sit with myself, I realised that this can't go on. I realised I wanted to be a better person, not just for my partner, but for everyone else as well, and for me, too. This isn't the first time something like this happened and I'm so tired of it happening just because I accepted the way I am, and didn't do anything to make it better before.

I wrote to a psychologist centre in the town where I study - I didn't realise that trying to find a therapist was this difficult, ha. So many aren't accepting new patients - and for a month, I didn't hear from anyone. In the meantime, I tried to mend the relationship and so far, I think and hope we're back on track and fine, but I know a therapist is needed nevertheless.

I open my email today and there it is: we have a date for you, it's next month, confirm that you're coming. I'm so, so relieved that this is finally happening, that this is my start for a life anew, but I'm also so incredibly scared of what's coming. I want to be able to see myself as a normal person; I have body image issues, I used to struggle with bulimia, I can't get rid of dermatillomania, I suspect I might have depression (but I obviously don't want to diagnose myself, I'm not an expert and it might as well just be me), and I just want to feel normal emotions again. I'm still scared that a psychologist tells me that there's nothing wrong with me, that I'll have to learn how to live with everything, that this is just me. Or that I'm incapable of change. 

I want to ask anyone who's reading this and has experience with therapy, do you have any tips? Any words of consolation? Should I be scared? What can I expect from a first session? I think I'm gonna go crazy if I think about it too much. Anything is truly appreciated.

1plknu4,My partner sincerely believes he needs to step out of the relationship to discover himself,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I hope someone could help.

My partner and I, we've been through a lot. Recently I convinced him to seek professional help as he had a lot of childhood trauma that made us believe the reason why he has avoidant tendencies, and to help us finally build a healthy relationship.

Now instead of helping, it seems to be hurting the relationship because therapy revealed he has no sense of self, that he tends to just adapt. Now he has convinced himself that he needs to be alone in healing and in discovering himself.

I am actually glad that therapy brought him to this realization, but there is hope in me that discovering oneself does not always need to be done outside the context of relationship. That therapy can also help practice selfhood while relating with others. Part of me says this is his avoidance talking.

Now I know, I cannot control whatever he decides. But do you really think one needs to be out of relationship to discover oneself? Can't a healthy relationship provide room for self-discovery?

Currently I asked him to be open and still try, even when he said he is afraid that he might be just adapting again. Still, he remains to be present in our relationship like we didn't just have a long-ass conversation about him wanting out.

1pld7bl,"Frustrated with my therapist of over a year, we’re getting nowhere","I’ve been seeing the same therapist for over a year and I’ve been feeling frustrated over our/my progress for a good few months now. We have good personality mesh and I feel comfortable enough to share everything, which hasn’t been true for my previous therapists. I think we’re doing CBT, I’m not even sure, but it just feels like our sessions go nowhere. 

We process whatever it is I’m feeling and thinking for the week, and I get ‘homework’ to think about and complete by the next session. But my homework are like ‘complete this small goal’ and ‘think about this thing, how it makes you feel, what you think’. This unfortunately feels pointless to me. We’ve named our therapy goals but I don’t understand how we’re even working towards them. 

I’ve expressed my frustrations to them a few times, but the response has always been that they can only guide me and I have to put in work. I feel like I have been putting in work, I’m doing the homework even though it feels arbitrary. Like???? I feel like something is obviously not working and I’m not understanding what we’re doing, shouldn’t we maybe try something else? 

I have an awful tendency/default of being negative towards myself, and I feel they’ve been trying to CBT me into being more positive but?? What are we even doing right now?

1plk1c3,Leaving therapy more destabilized – trauma sensitivity issue or poor fit?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for a neutral outside perspective and some professional or lived-experience insight.

I’ve been in outpatient therapy for a longer time. Initially the focus was childhood trauma, later also depression, anxiety, panic and strong physical stress reactions.

I didn’t choose my current therapist freely – the change happened for organizational reasons after my former therapist left the practice.

During one session focused on childhood trauma, I experienced a severe physical trauma response (strong muscle spasms / loss of control). My therapist didn’t notice it at the time.

It took me a lot of courage to bring this up in a later session. When I described what had happened physically, she responded with something like: “I can’t see that.”

There was no further clarification or discussion about how to handle such bodily trauma reactions or flashbacks in the future.

In a recent session I brought this up again and explained how alone and ashamed I had felt. Her response was: “I don’t know what to say to that.”

Again, there was no follow-up, no stabilization, no joint plan for dealing with physical trauma reactions.

I have also previously shared suicidal thoughts (not with intent or a plan, but as an expression of overwhelm), intense inner pressure and panic. These topics were not explored further.

In the last session I showed visible stress reactions (shaking, freezing, strong agitation), which again were not addressed or stabilized.

After sessions I increasingly feel more destabilized than before, with poor sleep and several days of suicidal thoughts afterward.

There have also been other situations that felt unsettling, such as:

	•	being compared to another patient (“she is fitter than you”)

	•	repeated suggestions of pausing or questioning whether therapy can continue, without offering a clear supportive framework

My main questions are:

	•	Does this sound more like a poor therapeutic fit / lack of trauma-informed care?

	•	Or could I be overinterpreting due to high sensitivity?

	•	At what point is a conscious ending of therapy the healthier option?

I’m not looking to blame anyone – I’m trying to understand whether this therapy is currently helping or potentially doing harm.

1pljy5n,Advice for managing clinical depression and shame from family members?,"2024 was an extremely difficult year for me academically, financially, and emotionally. Things became so overwhelming that I ended up in a psychiatric ward after an unaliving attempt, and I had to take a year off from university to heal and try to rebuild myself. During that time, I was struggling with severe mental health issues and unhealthy emotional attachments that I’m still working through in therapy.

On the academic and financial side, I was funded by a government bursary, but I lost it because my family’s income was slightly above the required threshold. My mental health deteriorated so much that I couldn’t focus, missed assignments, and performed poorly throughout the year. I was dealing with constant unaliving ideation and eventually got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. Now, I’m trying to transfer to another institution, but I have to go through a readmission process.

Recently, I was rejected by my dream uni, and it triggered a lot of anger and disappointment from my family. They brought up unrelated things like the fact that I failed my driver’s license test twice, which they paid a lot of money for. On top of that, my whole family—including my younger sister—was upset with me for losing my mom’s phone the other day, even though she got a new one and avoided speaking to me. When I tried to express my emotions and cried, they told me I was being too dramatic and that, because I’m 21, I “need to be strong enough to handle things"".

I took responsibility for my actions and have apologize for it. The phone situation happened when I was not noticing my surroundings, went out of the car to by groceries and my mind was fixated on the groceries. I am bettering myself everyday and yes this won't be the last time I make mistakes. The issue is not I wont take accountability but is that I did and still on my neck about it.

My therapist in session the other day started off asking how I'd been and then she told me she had dreamt about me the other day and I was sitting in session and told her I'm ready to talk about something that is a huge roadblock for me.

This thing is something I've never told anyone and really have felt like I can't even bring it to session, it a weird thing my mum did when I was growing up that I have a lot of shame around.

Anyway, I told a couple of friends who are also in therapy when they asked how my session went and they both instantly thought it was unprofessional. I hadn't even really considered it to be honest.

She's always one who shares a lot, about her life and family and stuff and things about her in general and how she parents or is a grandparent. I just thought that was an extension of it.

1pknit0,Should I stay in a relationship where my boyfriend has a sexual preference that hurts me emotionally?,"Hi everyone. I really need gentle advice because I’m emotionally exhausted and confused.

My boyfriend has a sexual preference that stems from something traumatic he experienced as a child. Because of that trauma, he is attracted to transgender women. He told me he tried to “hate” that part of himself, he feels ashamed of it, but he also feels like it’s something he keeps going back to. He says he loves me fully, and I genuinely believe he loves me. I’ve seen his effort, his sweetness, and how much he cares about me.

But here’s the problem:

Even though he says I’m everything he wants in a partner, he still looks for hookups with transgender women on the side. He reassures me it’s “just oral” or casual and that if anything more happens he would use a condom. But the truth is… it still hurts me deeply.

I’ve tried to accept that part of him for a long time. I tried to be understanding because I know his past trauma shaped this. But a part of me can’t ignore how painful it is to see flirting messages on his phone or to feel like I’m sharing him with other people. It doesn’t sit right with me emotionally or morally, even though I tried so hard to pretend I was okay.

We’ve been together for a year, basically living together 24/7. I’m extremely attached to him. We had beautiful plans for our future. I truly love him. But now I feel stuck. I don’t know if I should keep fighting for this or walk away for my own peace.

He keeps telling me he only loves me, and the rest is just a “need” he can’t control. But I’m struggling. I feel torn between compassion for his trauma and the pain of feeling betrayed.

I’m not trying to judge anyone’s sexuality. I’m just a person who fell in love and is now hurting and confused. Please be kind.

1plcvqg,Needing advise.,"Hello I’m age 16, F and need advise.

I recently got kicked out of my mothers house and moved in with my grandma. I’m still in shock. My mom and I have really never had a good relationship before as she had me pretty young and raised me without a father figure until I was around 6. My step dad and I don’t get along either as my mom has basically chosen him over me because they have children together which is understandable. (my step father literally told my mom to choose him or me once).. We got into a huge argument around a week ago because my step father tends to have outbreaks and breaks things recently breaking my moms car windshield which we had to repair. After this my mother got a protection order telling my boyfriend and I she’s going to divorce him. Soon enough he’s back in the house and I have 0 respect for him because I don’t see him as my father because of things he’s said / done over the years. Also I’m confused because this has happened between him and my mother MULTIPLE times yet she takes him back over and over even after saying she’ll divorce him. My mom tends to be really manipulative and narcissistic as well. Calling me a narcissist and a gaslighter at the ripe age of 13 not even knowing what that was at the time. I’m basically just confused on why she can’t step up as a mom and if I’m crazy and self centered. My mom and I also argued a 

lot due to a lot of verbal abuse she put me through and leaving me with her children (my siblings) to “babysit” on the regular 24/7. I even had to watch her recently 1 year old plus to other children under the age of 8 for 8 hours by myself which I don’t really think should be my responsibility at the age of 16 . It wasn’t just a one time thing either this was basically everyday. I also cleaned our house every single day and cleaned up after everyone. Even doing that my mom would find things to complain about saying I either “did nothing in the house” or “didn’t do it good enough”. Back to the verbal abuse part she’s called me a lot of curse words and just some really nasty things and they hurt a lot because I don’t want to hear those things about ME from my own mom. I just wanted her to love me and care for me and have a regular relationship but unfortunately we don’t have that. The day she kicked me out completely she called me a wh.re and said I was “cheating on my boyfriend” even though I’m not.. When I told her I was sorry and just going to go to my grandmas to live for now on because I have literally no where else to go she said “great you can finally be someone else’s problem”. I think I’m just in shock honestly. I’m still trying to grasp this because I just don’t know how to feel or what to say. I currently have a court date soon with my grandmother for my grandma to obtain full custody of me. My question is basically is this normal from a parent or is this giving off narcissistic parent behavior. I just don’t know how to feel or what to do. I’m in shock.

1pl854w,Friend with DID,"Hi, so I'm new to reddit but I'm not sure where to go with this.

So my friend has DID, and my friends and I aren't sure how to help. Their alters yell at them a lot, and because of this they tend to space out very often. Some days are harder than others, the worse time being on a 10-minute walk they ended up spacing out around 5 times. we used to be able to bring them back easily, by talking to them or a push to their arm, but its a lot harder now. They're now responding to things while spaced out, eating food and even responding to short questions with a head nod. 

Recently they got a new alter at lunch, but they can't see them. They say it's like when you can sense someone watching you/someone's presence, but they have never seen them in their head which is abnormal for their system. My friends and I however have, they are very cold and monotone and the polar opposite to my friend. I know a lot of alters come from new trauma, but my friend hasn't said anything, and none of us are sure how to help.

1pl7enc,Is talking therapy supposed to make me feel horrid about myself?,"I’ve been doing talking therapy with a counsellor. This is the third time I’ve tried counselling and I’ve had similar experiences with the past ones as this one.

Whenever I have tried explaining my issues to her, I always feel like she puts words in my mouth or tries to twist what I was saying. I’ve come out of every session feeling even more awful about myself and with lower self worth, despite the fact I have been going there to try and solve the problem of me hating myself.

For example, she has interpreted things I’ve told her in the following ways:

1. I told her I try really hard at everything but feel like I never improve —> she implied I weaponised incompetence and didn’t actually want to improve so I can stay helpless and cared for.

2. I enjoy being with my friends but feel extreme anxiety and shame afterwards because I felt like I was being a bad person —> I’m anxious after we hang because I can’t control their thoughts anymore 

3. I act in a way that in retrospect I wish I hadn’t, but I can’t help it because I’m unable to mask, and feel ashamed of myself afterwards—> actually, I’m not acting like my true self with my friends, and that’s why I’m anxious.

4. I feel shame and guilt for everything because I don’t match up to my own expectations and values and I don’t think I can —> I’m ashamed because I want people to like me and I can’t control them.

5. I can’t see any way out of this, nothing seems to work, I never feel better and I’m tired of constantly trying and failing. —> nothing works because I don’t want it to. 

These are just the most notable instances. It feels like she doesn’t listen to me at all, but my self-worth is so low that I can’t trust myself when I think “she’s being a bad therapist” because I think it’s more likely that I am the problem… which is what I *always* think. Hence, the therapy. 

Now, I’m just wondering if the reason I can’t get on with therapy is because I actually am just as awful in reality as I feel like I am. That I don’t really have low self-worth, I just am a bad person who deserves this shame and misery I feel.

Am I supposed to feel this way? Is she right and I’m even worse than I’d already thought? Is all my self hatred just an easy way for me to victimise myself rather than face this supposed reality that I’m actually just lazy and desperate to control my friends?",2,3,2025-12-13 05:40:28,ElfLadyLeia,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1pl7enc/is_talking_therapy_supposed_to_make_me_feel/,therapy,1.0,Advice Wanted,-0.9935,-0.06275946275946274,0.0,1,-0.3106018925518925,-1

1pl3raw,How to escape my own mediocrity?,"Hello,


# Question —

I want to do better, to escape this perceived hamster wheel of a life (9-5 till 65), but I see my own limitation and mediocrity... What should I do? Am I doomed?



# Context —

I am 23M, and facing severe depression and questioning life.I took 4 years in Uni (computer science), where it was all online, bar for finals. Due to covid the 1st 2 years, then my own introvertedness.



I've grown up in a somewhat remote area, in the sense that you need a car drive to get anything or anyone.



It's been a year and 2 or 3 months since I graduated, and thus can consider that I've been indoors for the better part of 5 years.


For all that period, I look back now and find that I have been doing nothing. Aside from studying online for Uni, my days were the same nothing.


Now, I feel as if I have wasted my life. Reality hit me. I was a top student in school and subconsciously expected that everything will be laid out for me. It won't. It isn't.


But I have become like a sitting dead. Am I really alive?


I'm not contributing to anything. My parents do everything, and I have been spoiled into a sloth... Single child with older parents I guess?


Anyhow. I think about having a job. I have been since I graduated... But the idea of sitting in an office 9-5, or rather 7-6 if you factor traffic, until I'm 65... It terrifies me.


I am not suicidal, but is such a life worth it? Why do we have to burn our healthier lives to love longer as elderly? Provided we even can do that.


This fear has even barred me from learning to drive. When my friends started driving at 16, here I am at 23 and still can't drive a car on public roads

This fear has prevented me from going into frontend, 99.9% of the job market here. (I loved programming, but I found out nothing is as simple as the early days of the internet anymore) 


I want to be free, to do whatever I want, even if that is doing nothing at all, but dreams are different from reality.




I am stuck in a quagmire of monotonic inaction, from which I am too terrified to struggle out of.



I know that I am not a genius, nor do I have the sharpest of wits, nor do I believe in the lucky mentality. 


Thereby, I know that If I go office job, I'm probably stuck for good. I'm not smart enough to ""hustle"" my way out, or shorten the duration.


And because I see my own ceiling, I know that I won't be one of those 1-in-a-million that make it out through content creation (music, art, Youtuber, etc. etc.)


I do not know why, but I have always been a drop-midway kind of person.


I look back at those 5 years, and all I see for it is a half-baked writing folder, full of ideas but not a single novel. A half-baked attempt at game dev, same as before.  


It is extremely easy to do nothing but game and listen to music all day, or rather dull myself with them like some drug.


But I'm growing older. My body ages yet my mind is still stuck in highschool, often time regretting wht I have always been such an introvert, action-shy child.



What should I do? What can I do?

I see people my age who are ridiculously successful, and I don't envy them. They had luck or talent, or put endless hard work, or all of it. But I realize one thing:


I could have been there, yet here am I.


I step back through the years and look at my life. One fork is a staircase upwards to fulfillment and happiness, and the other is a loop on itself, barely a step away.


I do not know if someone else has experienced this. You want to be there (yourself that you imagined in X years), but you look down and see that it is X year, but you aren't even 1% ""there""



Now, after all this time, I have become emotionally dead. I have passion for nothing. I'm not interested in anything... If I look at myself, I realize that I am nobody.


They say pour yourself into your passion and success could follow, or just blend in with everyone else. 


The latter idea kills me, yet I am so mediocre of a nobody that such idea feels inevitable, unless... There is no unless... I'm not suicidal, nor will I ever be.


But I do not see a point, or rather, I refuse such a life, yet am powerless to change it.


I am not as hardworking as a Pewdiepie, as talented as an Ado, as passionate as a Markiplier, or as lucky as a lottery winner.


Do I really want to write novels? Do I really want to make games? I don't even know anymore. I feel nothing.


I ponder and see no path to any sort of success, because of my own mediocrity, leaving only the path of blending into the crowd and becoming a lifeless gear... Was I born for this? I know it is up to everyone to find their own meaning of life, but what if I can't?


In my isolation, have life become so terrifying that I do nothing? I keep giving endless excuses... We don't have mkney to get a driving license... I'm too stupid for this... I'll try tomorrow... Etc etc.


In the end, as I said, the years fly by whilst I'm still an 18 year old boy dulling himself with music and games.


Sometimes I jokingly tell myself that if I were born a girl, I'd probably just marry a guy and just take care of the house and the kids. Hey, maybe that's why my girl (space) friends were grinding social skills since school x.x (if this offended you, I'm sorry, I'm from a 3rld world and the concept of house husband doesn't exist xd, but even that concept does not mean a lazy man. Anyhow. Just ignore this paragraph)


# Credits? 

Sorry for this post. I've been suffering from anxiety for a few days and I have no one to tell, nor do I want to worry my old parent. Stuck in a big box of concrete and the internet.



Also, sorry for the too somber of a post. It's okay if this gets deleted. I wanted to speak to someone at least, even if that someone is just a markdown text box.



**tl;dr how do you escape your own mediocrity, or are some people destined to be faceless gears in life?**

1pl2ylo,I have feelings for my psychologist and it makes me anxious. Is this normal? Should I bring it up?,"Hello everyone,

I have been seeing my psychologist for a few weeks now, and I feel a strong emotional attachment that I don't quite understand.

To be clear:

• It's neither romantic or sexual.

• I'm not imagining anything and I don't have any fantasies.

It's more that:

• I feel understood, safe, and reassured with her.

• Her voice and the way she listens really calm me down.

• I often think about our sessions and imagine what she might say to help me.

• The idea of changing therapists makes me anxious because I feel that she is really right for me.

• I looked her up on social media out of curiosity, mainly to find out more about her and her training. 

After doing some research, I think this could be what is called positive transference, but I don't know much about psychology. I'm particularly afraid to bring up the subject because I'm afraid she'll tell me that we need to distance ourselves or that I should change therapists, and I really don't want that. I've often read that it's difficult to find a therapist who's really right for you, which makes me even more anxious...

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Is it acceptable to bring this up in therapy? Should I talk about it?

How do therapists generally react to this type of emotional attachment?

I'm afraid of being judged or perceived differently afterwards.

1pl7ir3,Seeking Closure,"I feel pathetic for reaching out to the internet for help but I’ve been carrying some baggage for much longer than I should and I need to feel like someone understands/relates. Before I even get started I want to say that I’ve been in therapy long before this incident and long after. 

In 2024 my ex and I were seeing each other again just hooking up. We’d been on and off for like 8 years at that point. We’d go months without speaking or seeing each other then out of nowhere I would feel this magnetic pull back to her and I’d fall in love with her all over again. It truly was magical tbh and that’s why I always went back to her because I thought it was meant to be. 

This time though, I felt like we’d never actually form a healthy relationship and I just had to call it quits. I missed her but I had to let it go. A few months pass and out of nowhere she starts sleeping with/dating one of my “best friends”. I remember the day I got the news so well I felt like I had been stabbed in the back and the chest at the same time. I didn’t sleep for 2 days. 

I made a conscious choice not to handle it myself and let karma do the work because i know my dumbass could’ve thrown everything I worked for away if I chose to act. But I must say I’ve done a terrible job at releasing control and letting karma do its thing. Every day since then I’ve been obsessed with different ways to get back at them without actually going to jail. It’d take nothing for me to go slash some tires or whatever but I’m just too smart for that. 

They’ve apparently gotten sober and gotten religious and everyone praises them for it but not many people know what they did to me and I just can’t let it go. Sometimes the only thing that gets me out of bed or motivates me is the chip on my shoulder. 

We’re heading into 2026 soon and I don’t want to carry this with me anymore but don’t know how to let it go and move on. I’ve been with amazing women and gotten in the best shape of my life and learned incredible things about my character but I just can’t sit peacefully knowing they got away with it with what they did to me.

1pku5on,I don't know how to process being uncomfortable with something my ex did and it's been bugging me for a bit.,"I just want to preface this by saying that my ex and I are on good terms with each other. She's still a very dear friend to me and I'm happy that I still get to have her in my life. We broke up because I realized that I'm aroace and we just weren't compatible with each other like that. I also want to preface by saying that I have trauma surrounding being sexualized from a young age.

That being said, lately I've found myself thoughts frequently returning to a memory I have from when we tried dating that makes me really uncomfortable but I dont know how to articulate why it bothers me so much and i don't know what to do with this discomfort. One night when we were still together romantically, we were on video call my ex started masturbating while I was trying to have a non-sexual conversation. I remember feeling really confused and really uncomfortable with the whole thing because she didn't ask me if i was cool with it or interested in seeing that and I remember being genuinely at a lose for words, so I kinda just let her do her thing while I tried to avoid looking at her and continue with the conversation like nothing was happening. She did that for the entire conversation until I hung up. I didnt enjoy that experience at all and thinking about it now makes me feel really uncomfortable. In hindsight the relationship as a whole felt oversexualized and that makes me uncomfortable. 

The problem is I don't know what to do with this discomfort now. My ex and I have broken up months ago and we're on reay good terms now. But I can't stop ruminating on that specific memory and how it makes me feel, nor can I seem to articulate how it makes me feel in a way that makes sense. 

I have therapy next week on Thursday and I want to bring this up to her in our next session, but i don't really know what to say to her.

1pl608n,Student looking for affordable long-term therapy options (not one-time sessions),"Hey everyone,
I’m a student and I’m looking for advice on finding an affordable therapist I can work with long-term, not just a single or short-term session.

I’ve been dealing with ongoing anxiety and mental overload, and I’ve realized I’d really benefit from having one consistent therapist—someone I can build trust with and check in with over time whenever things start piling up.

Because I’m a student, my budget is pretty limited, so I’m wondering:
	•	What low-cost or sliding-scale therapy options are available for students?
	•	Are there platforms, clinics, or programs that allow ongoing sessions rather than quick, one-off conversations?
	•	Has anyone had good experiences with school counseling services, community clinics, or online therapy that are affordable long term?

I’m not looking for emergency support—just a reliable, professional space to work through thoughts and anxiety over time.

Any advice, personal experiences, or resources would be really appreciated. Thanks 🙏

1pl5twi,Trauma Dumping because I need advice and have no where else to go,"Hello Reddit, I’m writing this because I have no idea what is going on in my life, and never have. 
For context: my biological father abandoned me when I was 3. 
It all started when I was around 5, my grandfather who my mother and I lived with started sexually assaulting me. It started off as little things, touching my back making his way to my breasts, to grabbing my private parts. This is important to remember. My mother met a man named Bo and got married quickly. Bo became mentally and physically abusive right after their marriage. He’d slam me into walls, spit in my face, drag me down the hallway by my hair, and play hide and seek with knives. Bo was a chef, so if young me didn’t like his food, he would starve me locked in my room for days. Bo lived with us for 10 years. During the end of Bo and my mom’s marriage, my grandparents moved into our guest room. My grandmother was my bestfriend, and knew about the abuse. She had moved in to keep us safe, but she unknowingly put me back into danger. 
You see, my mother was sexually abused by her father (my grandfather) at a young age. Nothing was ever done, my grandmother didn’t believe her and didn’t address it. When I was around 13, my grandfather began to touch me again. He would sneak into the bathroom when I was showering, and would often “rub my back” and move his hands down towards my breasts. One night, I had a friend over at my house(I didn’t realize the unsafe living situation at the time, it was my normal). My grandfather grabbed my butt when I was unloading the dishwasher and my friend saw. Later that night, she came to me crying and told me my grandfather had ran his fingers up and down her leg telling her to keep it a secret. My friend told my mom what was happening because I didn’t understand why she was upset, that was normal for grandpas to do..right? My mom kicked him out of the house that night. My step father did nothing but laugh and try to argue it was fine. Later, my mom found out that my stepfather was using meth, which gave us our freedom and her divorce. That was when I was 15. I’m 21 now, and everything still haunts me to this day. I developed an eating disorder, mental health issues, and substance abuse and still struggle. I’ve tried therapy and counseling numerous times and still feel trapped by my thoughts. From ages 16-20 I was raped twice and sexually assaulted 5 times. 
I work at an Assisted living community as a server now. Today a resident touched me inappropriately and whispered in my ear, “you’re a good girl, you know that?” I broke down in front of my coworkers and got sent home. I can still feel his hands on my waist, just like my grandpa did. I know this is probably not a good career for me, and am leaving January 5th. I feel guilty for some reason, but also a little bit proud that I finally stood up for myself. 
I just need help knowing how others may have overcome similar situations. I try to be kind towards everyone, I’m a Christian and don’t wear revealing clothing, my uniform for serving is long pants and a long sleeve shirt and my everyday clothes are usually jeans and a tshirt.

1pl5mqx,I think I’m gonna stop looking for a therapist.,"I’ve been searching for a new therapist for about five months now, and at this point it feels ridiculous.

I’m trying so hard. I’m exhausted. I’m frustrated. And I’m getting real close to accepting that maybe my ideal therapist just exists in theory and not in the actual physical world.

1pksq84,Ended therapy after admitting transference — now struggling with loneliness and comparison,"Hi everyone,
English isn’t my first language, so I’m using ChatGPT to help me organize my thoughts and express myself clearly.

I’m a 29M. About two years ago, I started therapy. I initially went to a very experienced therapist in his 50s. After a few sessions, he suggested EMDR, but since his schedule was very full, he referred me to another therapist in the same clinic who specialized in EMDR.

She was a woman around my age.

We tried EMDR for 3–4 sessions, but it didn’t really work for me / I didn’t like it. What I did notice, though, was that the talking part of those sessions felt really good and helpful. I told her I’d prefer to just talk and not do EMDR. She agreed.

That turned into about 1.5 years of therapy.

At first, we talked a lot about a girl I couldn’t get over — someone who wasn’t even my girlfriend and where I felt deeply misunderstood. Then another girl. Then I entered a relationship that lasted a little over a year. During that time, my therapist helped me see that the relationship wasn’t healthy for me and encouraged me to leave it. She supported me a lot through the breakup.

We talked about my family, my life, my fears, my patterns — everything.

At some point, I realized I had started developing feelings for her. Even when I was still in a relationship, those feelings were there, but they felt manageable and not something I focused on too much.

In the last few weeks, I had some very positive experiences in my life that boosted my confidence and made me feel stronger. That gave me the courage to have difficult conversations that I had been avoiding.

So I went to my therapist and told her I thought there was transference. I thought that was the correct term. In reality, I was trying to say that I had feelings for her.

We talked about it openly, and we decided to end the therapy process.

I then went back to my original therapist (the older one at the same clinic).

Now I’m left with a strange sense of loneliness.

She used to nourish me emotionally in a way that my friends and even my family don’t — not because they’re bad, but because the space was unique. Safe, attentive, consistent. It also raised my standards for choosing a partner a lot.

I find myself comparing everyone to her.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting this — maybe perspective, maybe reassurance that this feeling passes, or maybe just to know I’m not alone in experiencing something like this.

For me:

* I don’t buy clothes unless there’s an actual need or occasion. In the age of fast fashion, this somehow makes me look outdated or stingy.
* When I take a free trial for apps like YouTube Premium or Spotify, I set a reminder a day before it ends and cancel it to avoid autopay. Friends say it’s too much effort.
* I prefer cleaning my own car rather than having it done by someone else. It saves money, and strangely, even though it’s tiring, it gives me a sense of calm and mental relaxation that’s hard to explain.

None of these feels dramatic, but over time, they’ve genuinely helped me.

1pq9ms0,Is there more to life than smoking weed and playing video games?,"31M, gainfully employed with my own apartment and a car that's fully paid off. From the outside, these would indicate a generally successful person right? But aside from those things, my life is more or less meaningless. Not particularly close to family, and my friends are all scattered about the country with the nearest one being a 4 hour drive away. Dating is pretty much out of the question due to having avoidant personality disorder which is effectively a death knell for any sort of meaningful relationship being able to form. I've tried therapy, but the places my insurance covers basically can only provide social workers who do not have the tools needed to fix what I've got going on.

So I fall back on the tried and true combo of weed + video games to pass the time. Any attempt to break out of this cycle via other activities always results in the same thing. 

I picked up DJing in college, but shortly before graduation my hard drive failed and took out my entire music collection along with it. For the past 9 years now I've tried to build it back up again, but simply opening up the software to see the empty library creates such an overwhelming feeling that I instinctively resort to old faithful.

I used to lift weights, but now everytime I try getting back into it I inevitably end up injuring myself in some stupid way. Currently it's a trapezius strain, and trying to schedule PT for it results in either the online scheduling app not working, or their phone line being perpetually on hold. Weed and video games to the rescue!

People typically say ""join a club"" in these sorts of scenarios, but where these clubs can be found is beyond my skill level. Upon recommendation from threads similar to this one I've tried websites like meetup, only to discover that the only thing people around here are interested in is pickleball apparently. Going to a bar seems like the logical thing to do for someone my age, but I have literally never gone to a bar on my own nor do I particularly want to do so. 

It's like those satirical flow diagrams with multiple pathways all leading to the same destination, only mine is real and it just ends in me smoking weed and playing video games when I get home from work every single day.",183,80,2025-12-19 08:04:12,LiL_BrOwNiE247,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pq9ms0/is_there_more_to_life_than_smoking_weed_and/,selfimprovement,0.96,Question,0.9782,0.06886904761904762,0.0,1,0.3072338095238095,1
1pqav3m,Stopping drinking - need to vent it out,"For context: 35 Male, married with no kids.   
  
I was at a wedding reception celebrating my friend’s marriage. I got drunk with some friends, not realizing it was the fourth night in a row I’d been drinking pretty heavily. My wife had been patient up until then, but I was definitely pushing her to her limit.

After the reception, when we got back to our hotel room, she gave me some time to sober up. Once I was clear-headed enough to talk, she finally let me have it, and she was absolutely right to. My drinking had gotten out of control. I was constantly at the bar, buying rounds for people, and had basically become “the guy with a drink in his hand.” It was frustrating her and affecting how we communicated.

Seeing her sitting there crying and telling me how hurt and frustrated she was hit me hard. That was the moment I realized I needed to make a change. Right then and there, I decided I was done drinking. It’s been five days now, and honestly, I haven’t even had the urge. I went out with coworkers the other night and just had a club soda with lime.

I’ve always told myself that if drinking ever started to hurt the people around me or impact my life the next day, that would be my sign to stop. I guess this was my wake-up call. I promised my wife I’d give it up. There’s no timeline on it. Could be months, years, or maybe forever.

Keep it private until it's permanent, your success, your love life, your plans, your income, your happiness, your dreams.
Not everything needs an audience while it is still forming. Seeds grow best in the dark, not under constant attention. 

When you expose something too early, you invite opinions, doubt, jealousy, and noise before it has roots. Not everyone deserves access to the parts of your life that are still growing. Some people will smile, but secretly hope you fail. Some will question you, not because they care, but because they cannot see beyond their own limits, and some will drain your energy simply by knowing too much. 

Protect what matters. Move quietly, build in silence. Let your discipline be louder than your announcements. You don't owe updates. You don't need validation. You don't need approval to become who you are meant to be. 

When the work is done, when the foundation is strong, when the results are real, you won't need to explain anything. Let the results speak for you. 

If this resonated, comment silence. Follow for more reminders like this.

1pqgv2s,Is it common for personal growth to drive friends away?,"I'm 23 and up until this year, for the past 14 years I've been dealing with severe mental health issues caused primarily by trauma. I've worked with therapists and have tried to implement everything I've learned into my day to day life but I've noticed recently it's been causing me friendships that I held dearly.

For example, I asserting my boundaries in a calm and non accusatory way instead of bearing the discomfort of violations with someone who I considered my best friend.

Less than a month later I seem to have lost another friend by communicating my feelings that I had been hurt by something he had done. I explained that I did not need an apology and I just wanted to get it off my chest because I don't want to let it simmer. He gave a deflective and contradictory response to which I pointed out the contradictions and said I needed to take a break. He blew up at me, and said some very rude things in response. 

I've noticed over the past year he's been drinking more and more as well and his personality has changed a lot from the person I once new so it's not like my choice to take a break was out of nowhere. I didn't want to see someone I cared about destroy himself.

I guess these two incidents have left me wondering if I'm the problem or if I'm just starting to have self worth for the first time in my life. I noticed that I had a radical change in my self worth after receiving EMDR therapy and have been trying to not avoid emotional subjects that were previously difficult to me.

I'm deathly scared of becoming the thing I dislike the most, a hypocrite so I would greatly appreciate input. Thanks.

her take was that a lot of what we think are personality traits are actually just old feelings that got stuck. like your nervous system learns ""this isn't safe to feel"" and then builds walls around it. the anxiety isn't YOU, it's your body's protection from feeling something underneath.

idk if i fully buy it but it's been rattling around in my head.she said something like ""i thought i was shy. i thought i was anxious. to watch those things go away was wild."" and that hit different because i literally cannot imagine not being anxious. like what would that even feel like. anyone actually changed something they thought was just their personality? or is this cope

1pqd95u,I'm finally hopeful after struggling mentally for years,"After over 15 years of struggling mentally, financially, failed relationships after failed relationships, I'm finally able to jump over that mental hurdle of thinking ""will this ever end? When will I finally be happy?"" 

I'm 28f and almost my entire life I've had a hard time mentally, from a mixture of child trauma, severe anxiety and depression starting at a very young age, which has negatively affected my life, so much so that I have felt the urge to end things many, many times. 

I've struggled with finding decent employment while juggling going to college for the last 12 years, seeming to never find my passion. I didn't do so well in highschool and felt like giving up on my academic future. 

In 2018 I had been accepted into a prestigious college for their architecture program. I did relatively well and believed I had found my passion. During that time I got into a relationship that at first I believed was with the person I was going to marry. I'm 2020 I was struggling badly with my mental health, stress and anxiety were taking over me. After he had broken up with me I was at my lowest, I dropped out of college and then COVID happened. 

I was a mess. My mental health was at the lowest it had ever been and I put myself into the hospital. Ever since that moment it's been a difficult time climbing the mountain of getting back to a stable place. Me and my ex got back together and long story short he proposed, then he broke up with me again last year and I have been climbing that mountain again. 

But this time, I think I finally passed over it. I'm back in the architecture program, got a 4.0 and on the deans list, a good job with stable income, and a new relationship with someone who respects me, appreciates me, treats me like a human being even when I'm struggling, and someone who I know will end up being my husband. I have an interview with a prestigious architecture firm for an internship, I'm on my way to get a masters degree, and house hunting with my boyfriend.

The reason I'm writing this all out is I was hopeless for a very, very long time. I never thought I'd be able to say that I'm happy and excited for the future. I never thought I'd get over that mountain that felt so insurmountable, the dread and anxiety that was holding me back, the depression that was soul crushing. But I did, and I want to let those that struggle know that you can, too! Just keep pushing, keep fighting for yourself, fight for your mind, your happiness, your comfort and your loved ones. It will get better, and the fact that I believe that after years of telling myself it never will is mind-blowing.

1pq5emg,I lost the weight and I’m still insecure. How do I gain my confidence back?,"I began gaining weight when Covid began and gained about 23 pounds in five years. In May, I began a very strict diet and was able to lose 33 pounds in seven months. I am officially at a very healthy weight and am very happy with how I look. 

Here’s the problem. I was always very confident and felt like could talk to any man. When I gained the weight, I was still confident until I realized I got very few likes on dating sites, men didn’t flirt with me as much, and if I flirted with a man it was rarely reciprocated. I became shy, more introverted, and stopped really trying when it came to men. 

Last night, at our company Christmas party, I saw a man who worked at the venue and he was… REALLY handsome. My colleague asked the venue’s Events Coordinator (who we work with regularly) if the guy was single, mentioning that I thought he was handsome. I know, very high school, but she was a mom who wanted to play matchmaker and I let her. The EC said he was single, straight, and was probably looking…

The thing is, I was too shy to do anything about it! I kept thinking about those men who I was interested in, but who were just being nice, and didn’t give me a second look. I kept thinking of those awkward looks that I got whenever I tried to flirt. I keep hearing my cousin asking if I thought I was going after guys who were out of my league. I literally came face to face with him, neither of us said a word, but we clearly lingered, and my brain is still telling me “he won’t be interested in you.”

How do I work on getting my confidence back up? I know I was always worthy, but how do I work on feeling it again?

1pp8uyq,20 stoic lessons that make you stronger,"Anger is a punishment you inflict upon yourself.

Discipline is the highest form of self-love.

The ego is the enemy, remain humble.

Do what is right, not what is easy.

You become unstoppable when you stop seeking validation.

You do not have to respond to everything.

The world owes you nothing, earn your life.

Most fears are illusions, confront them.

Let go of what you cannot change, or it will control you.

The strongest person is the one who has control over himself.

Emotion kills logic, breathe, do not react.
You suffer twice when you worry about tomorrow.

Not everything deserves a response, silence wins battles.

If it will not matter in five years, let it go today.

Become the person your former self prayed to be.

Focus on the effort, not the outcome, the outcome belongs to fate.

A wise mind listens twice before speaking once.

Suffering turns into strength when you accept it.

Routine shapes fighters, chaos shapes victims.

Those goals didn’t fail all at once — I just slowly lost track of them.

For people who are good at long-term self-improvement:

* How do you *actually* keep track of multiple goals without burning out?
* What systems (or mental frameworks) help you stay accountable, especially for things that don’t have immediate feedback?

1pqbo9k,How to wake up early,"Wakeing up early hack

I have it very hardd to wake up early in the morning.  
Tried many many things scaring myself from fomo thought.that i will me the exam . Even did putting my arlar at distance it worked till a point . Asked mom to wake me up it worked till a point . Anddd many of things you can imagine. Motivation cursing myself suddenly standing straight out of blanket . Writing a task for next day a night before . Rock metal for Alarm ring . And what not !!! 

But thier was this only thing which helps me to wake up early  for the longest i have seen Thats going to gym or to play in the morning . I still remember the streak of 9 months without fail a single day even on sundays i used to wake up at 5 and go to gym . Many many time i woke up before the alarm or even the slightest sound of alarm was just enough. That was the best time good diet good sleep all the work going good . Even i was able to explore my interests and be lil creative . 

But as of now i don't have money to go gym tried homework outs it sucks honestly the taunting of parents never stops the eye i hate it . Constantly disturbing.  

Going outside to run and shit no air pollution is very high here i can't. I won't.  Go outside to run or park to workout . 

That time my parents were paying for my gym as soon college started time management fucked gym stoped diet went down . And i honestly have hard to find a income to pay for gym still tryng somehow i can earn to pay for gym . 

Now how do i wake up early like those day when i used tk go to gym . ????? 

I have no hard time to wakeing up late in the nightt but i made this sleep before 12 deadline still i am in college so the work still goes on nd some time i have to wake up til 2am or 3am . 
As of now i am sleeping literally 10-11 hours ??? 😵‍💫

1pqbmsv,"I stopped asking ""Am I improving?"" and started asking this instead","I work on myself daily, my habits, my mindset, my character. But recently, I caught myself asking a different kind of question.

How do I actually know if I’m improving?  
And more importantly… do I even need to?

For a long time, I treated self-improvement like a race.  
Always becoming someone else.  
Always chasing the next version.  
Always feeling like the present version wasn’t enough.

But then I paused.

Am I genuinely unhappy with how I’m living right now?  
Or am I just addicted to the idea of ""fixing"" myself?

I don’t believe growth means rejecting who you are.  
I don’t believe life is a checklist of goals waiting to be conquered.  
And I don’t believe peace comes from endlessly becoming ""better"".

What I’m learning is this:

Everything I need is already available in each moment.  
The discipline, the awareness, the choice, it’s all here.  
Growth isn’t about forcing improvement.  
It’s about using what’s already present with intention.

Some days, that looks like pushing harder.  
Other days, it looks like resting without guilt.  
Both can be acts of self-mastery.

I’m not trying to escape myself anymore.  
I’m learning to live honestly with who I am, and act consciously from there.

Maybe improvement isn’t about becoming someone else.  
Maybe it’s about being fully here, and using what life is already offering.

That feels like real progress to me.",0,2,2025-12-19 09:43:12,sahilverma5,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pqbmsv/i_stopped_asking_am_i_improving_and_started/,selfimprovement,0.45,Other,0.9934,0.13588311688311688,0.0,1,0.3251966233766233,1
1pq67bn,How do you stay consistent when motivation fades? Looking for practical strategies.,"I keep starting things with all this energy and then a few weeks in I just lose steam. Motivation is great at first but it doesn't last. I know discipline is the real answer but how do you actually build that?



I've tried:

\- Setting goals (they feel good to write down but then I forget about them)

\- Making schedules (I follow them for a few days then life gets in the way)

\- Accountability partners (it helps for a bit but then we both fall off)



I think my issue is I rely too much on feeling motivated to take action. But feeling motivated is inconsistent. So I'm looking for practical strategies that work even when you don't feel like doing the thing.

1ppi81d,"If a 29-year-old man told you ‘I don’t feel like a real man, but I want to become one,’ what advice would you give him?","I don’t feel like a real man, and I want to understand how to change that.

Here are the main reasons I feel this way:

* I’m a **29-year-old M virgin**, even though I wanted to date and lose my virginity much earlier in life. This wasn’t a lack of desire or confidence in attraction,I wanted it, it just never happened.
* There’s nothing wrong with me hormonally or sexually. I have a normal sex drive and interest in women, but dating never worked out. I could't get a single match on dating apps and due to Covid couldn't go out during my prime college years.
* I recently **left a healthcare job due to burnout** and am currently unemployed while actively looking for work and resetting my career.
* I’m **5’6” and about 290 lbs**, which I know puts me at a disadvantage. I’m dieting, working on weight loss, and taking this seriously. I am going to the gym consistently and dieting now.
* I’m **in therapy** and working with a **career coach** because I’m trying to fix things instead of ignoring them.

What really messes with my head is being told by people I know that being this far behind sexually means no woman would ever want me, regardless of personality, effort, or progress. I heard women will take a rapist or cheater over an older virgin without having to think twice. It makes me feel bad. My buddies even joke if they were in my shoes, they'd have slept with a drunk girl and made up some story to her about why she slept with me.

After hearing that enough times, it’s hard not to internalize the idea that I somehow missed a window that can’t be reopened.

So my question is honest and practical:  
If a 29-year-old man came to you feeling behind in life and masculinity but genuinely trying to rebuild, what would you tell him to focus on first?",65,92,2025-12-18 10:23:35,Pleasant-Opinion8409,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ppi81d/if_a_29yearold_man_told_you_i_dont_feel_like_a/,selfimprovement,0.89,Tips and Tricks,-0.9632,-0.0035714285714285626,-0.7611289024353027,-1,-0.6702387369319371,-1

1ppqo0v,"I’m a bad person, what do I do next?","I have always felt like a nice person, I try to do nice things for people when I can. I grew up in poverty on a third world country so I’ve seen horrible things happen and horrible people. So seeing how bad the average person was I praised myself as a good person. But I’m realizing that is wrong now. I’m a terrible person, I do the worst things. 

I ghost, I lie, I cheat on people that care about me. I don’t even think I’m a real person because I try to present myself as this good person to people by lying and manipulating them. Some of my actions are unforgivable. I get extremely jealous and bitter and I would harass people I don’t like if I know that it can’t be traced back to me.

I recently caused a woman to leave in a hobby group I'm in because I didn't like her, and I haven't seen her since then so I feel extremely guilty about it. It was not the first time doing something like this, but I feel horrible this time. 

I only truly do good things if there are people that can see it, I do bad things when they can’t see. Everyone thinks I’m lovely and good but I’m evil.

I feel extremely guilty about it, I think about all the people I’ve hurt and trust me, it’s a trail of them. I think about how bad they felt in that moment now. Why didn’t I have this self introspection while I was causing this harm? How can I make this go away? For the past month I can’t stop thinking about it.

Don’t try to soften my actions because I’ve done some sick shit, I haven’t committed any crimes but that’s probably because I know being arrested would harm me negatively and I don’t care for anything that is illegal, but I know if I did and knew I could get away with it, I probably would. I can’t help but think that when I die, my actions would be played for other people and everyone would hate me.

Even in my guilt I’m still thinking of how people perceive me. I feel like it’s too late for me to change, I can’t do anything without my evil actions coming to haunt me. 

I'm not religious, but I grew up religious, so I think my actions would come to hunt me and when I die I would have to go to a personal hell where everyone that has met me and thinks I'm nice find out all the terrible terrible things I have done. And they all judge and ostracise me, which I would deserve. I'm such a bad person.

This is applicable to everything, when you start going to the gym, it is those days which felt dull and mundane which later pay back dividends in your gains. 

In your career, the days where you were overburdened with responsibility yet you remain silent and dare to overcome that contribute to your success. And no I am not asking for you to get exploited, but to do something about it. Let it affect you.

1pp91q0,"I got hurt at the gym, doom scrolled for days, and it completely wrecked my dopamine (I tested it)","I’m posting this as a warning because I didn’t expect it to hit me like this.

I got hurt at the gym. Nothing catastrophic, but enough to stop me from training properly. That’s where the mistake happened.

I’d already cut out a lot of dopamine traps. No Nicotine/weed. Less junk food. Better sleep. Walking daily. I was actually feeling decent.

Since I couldn’t train, I replaced it with doom scrolling. Hard.  
News. Reels. Comment wars. “Truth” videos. Late at night. First thing in the morning.

Within a few days, everything went sideways:

* Intense cravings for shitty food
* Body aches and stiffness even though I was moving less
* Anxiety up, motivation gone
* Brain felt overstimulated but exhausted
* Everything felt heavier and harder than it should’ve

At first I blamed the injury.

Then I tested it...

I stopped scrolling. No news. No reels. No comment sections. Phone down except for essentials.

Within 48-72 hours

* Cravings dropped
* Body pain eased
* Mood stabilized
* Motivation came back
* Nervous system finally felt calm again

That’s when it clicked:  
The scrolling was the cause, not the injury.

The gym injury just removed my usual outlet and exposed how brutal constant stimulation actually is on the nervous system.

If you’re injured, burned out, or “resting” and replacing movement with endless scrolling, be careful. It doesn’t feel passive. It’s not neutral. It wrecked me faster than any substance ever did.

I end up sleeping more,  i stay in bed longer, i scroll i tell myself i’m finally resting

But by the end of the day i don’t feel lighter or reset, i just feel off  
kind of dull kind of tired in a way sleep doesn’t fix

days off used to feel like a pause like i could breathe again and now  smh they just… pass🥲

and i don’t even know when that shift happened, i didn’t have a breakdown or a big burnout moment it just slowly became this quiet thing.

i don’t know if it’s my phone or my brain or just life changing  
i just know rest doesn’t feel the way it used to. If anyone else feels this you’re not alone  
i’m still trying to understand it too

1ppheiu,reddit distraction & wanting to be better,"im 33F and ive been active on reddit since sept this year, actively talking to people and straying towards… nsfw conversations mostly coz there’s a lot of opportunities for that. ive explored my sexuality to an extend ive never done before (ive been single all my life) and it changed my perspectives on a lot of things. 

i find myself getting distracted a bit too much than what im supposed to, sometimes hitting almost 10 hours a day just on reddit. all im saying is, im tired of all this. tired of straining myself talking to people online and being horny just because im lonely. it makes me feel emptier than ever tbh. 

in between this im actually busy with work and study at the same time focusing on my thesis. i was struggling to get it started but i just got off a meeting with supervisor and she’s happy with my progress and there’s even opportunity for me to be part of an international symposium as my lecturer believes on my abstract and wanted to work on it together to submit it. i am so flattered because i never thought im good enough and i thought academia is not for me. 

i feel exhilarated and it couldn’t come at a better time. it suddenly makes me feel fulfilled that i don’t need any kind of nsfw distractions to make myself feel better. its like im back to my old self, free from the entanglement of emotions and overthinking that i don’t think is necessary at all.

i hope i can leave reddit for good for awhile, till i get myself sorted. im done chasing something unreal and temporary coz its making me feel emptier than ever and we all deserve so much more in this life. 

hope i can hear some kind words if you ever been through somewhat the same thing and how did you cope and feel better? i know its silly to get assurances from internet strangers but some of you guys have always been so awesome and i enjoyed reading all your replies.

1pplofj,Exploring something for people who feel but don't or can't express.,"I’ve been sitting with a question for a while and thought Reddit might be the right place to ask it. Most online spaces today feel… loud. We post constantly, but rarely say what we’re actually feeling. We’re connected all the time, yet oddly disconnected from ourselves and each other.

I’ve been part of a small group thinking deeply about this gap from a human-first angle. Why is it so hard to express emotions online without performing? Why do platforms optimise for reaction instead of reflection? And what would an internet space look like if feelings came before feeds?

One idea we’ve been exploring is a space where:

* expression starts with emotion, not content
* technology helps you reflect instead of being distracted
* conversations feel slower, calmer, and more human

This isn’t a pitch, and it’s very much still forming. Before anything concrete exists, I wanted to hear from people here:

* Do you feel this gap between expression and connection online?
* Have you ever used tools (journaling, communities, apps, anything) that helped you reflect emotionally or failed to?
* What would make a space like this genuinely useful rather than just another platform?

If this resonates, I’d love to learn how you think about it.

I'm not too much into those kinda groups so I can't comment on that,  but it did make me think about myself a bit and wondering if what I thought was something to improve my relations is actually just something selfish haha (which for me probably is the case)

I had said something today and my coworker was honest (I asked her to be) and she said it sounded attention seeking. And I thought - that’s valid. But if I felt I received the positive validation that I feel I give out to others often then I wouldn’t feel that way. I feel like I always want people to feel good about themselves or good in general. 

Example a coworker was sooooo excited about this shirt she wanted - it wasn’t my style but she was SO excited so of course I told her it’s so her and looks good on her. And you bet your bottom dollar when she got it and wore it I complimented her because she looked SOO happy wearing it. Another example - if someone came up to me to talk about dinosaurs and they were so interested and excited I would be too - why would I dampen their mood because I don’t like dinosaurs? They were excited enough to talk to me so why not be happy with them? 

I feel people around me/in general don’t think this way?

1pp2wt8,Why discipline finally worked when I made it boring,"

For a long time, I thought discipline was supposed to feel intense. Like you wake up one day super motivated, flip a switch, and suddenly you’re consistent, productive, and “locked in.” Every time I tried to build habits that way, it lasted maybe a week before I burned out or got overwhelmed.

What finally worked for me was doing the opposite. I stopped trying to make discipline exciting. I made it boring on purpose.

Instead of setting huge goals, I focused on things that were almost annoyingly small. Same wake-up window every day. Same 10-minute cleanup at night. Same grocery list. Same day every week to deal with bills and money. Nothing impressive. Nothing worth posting about. Just repetitive stuff that didn’t require motivation.

The biggest shift happened when I stopped relying on how I *felt* and started relying on structure. I realized that on tired days, stressed days, or low-energy days, motivation wasn’t coming to save me. But habits would still run if they were simple enough.

Money was a huge part of this. I used to avoid it because it stressed me out, which only made things worse. So I made my finances boring too. One budgeting day a week. Automatic payments an fewer accounts. 

Nothing about my life looks dramatic now. But it feels stable. Predictable. Calm. And that’s what made discipline stick. Once it stopped being about willpower and started being about systems, everything got easier.

Turns out discipline doesn’t have to feel powerful. It just has to keep working when you’re not.",8,6,2025-12-17 23:14:16,ComprehensiveNose622,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pp2wt8/why_discipline_finally_worked_when_i_made_it/,selfimprovement,0.79,Other,0.7873,-0.006896551724137916,0.0,-1,0.2348106896551724,1

My teacher did not like me. I told him I was being bullied by another kid (kicking me, sending rude emails with vulgar language) and he said “what am I supposed to do?”. With literal 0 ounce of care. I mean like I said, even with all my flaws, I was legit an elementary schooler. That response just felt cruel honestly. Even now as an adult, I feel like I know nothing when my coworkers talk to me. They are not that bad, but I feel like some of them definitely think I’m “weird” and don’t like me. They sometimes snicker at the things I say and twist its meaning and make fun of me for it. Why do I feel this way? Is there something wrong with me? Am I just born an outcast? How do I get out of this?

1po4p7c,"The day I realized my ""problems"" weren’t really problems","Yesterday, I was dealing with something that’s been bothering me a lot lately..... severe hair fall. Like most of us do, I went straight to the internet, trying to figure out possible reasons. Vitamin deficiency, mineral deficiency, best multivitamins for hair regrowth..... I was scrolling through all of it.

Just a little while before that, I was actually complaining to my mother about why she hadn’t brought the hair serum I had asked for. It felt like such a big issue at that moment.

While doing all this, I was standing outside in the winter sun, just soaking in some sunlight....as it is winter here

That’s when I noticed a woman, probably in her 50s, walking by with a child. They were collecting dry stems and branches, likely for burning. Whenever I see a child working like this, I instinctively ask about school. So I asked the woman whether the child goes to school.

She replied, “She’s not my child. She’s my neighbor’s daughter. She’s 21 years old.”

I was stunnedddd

I’m around 5'7"", and she was barely half my height..... frail, extremely thin. If you had asked me to guess her age, I wouldn’t have said more than 9 or 10......that moment shook me.

Here I was, upset about a hair serum and worried about which multivitamin is bestfor hair regrowth..... while standing just a few feet away from someone whose entire body told a story of lifelong malnourishment. Not because of choice, but because of circumstance.

It really made me reflect on how privileged many of us are. We worry about optimization..... better hair, better skin, better health..... while some people don’t even have the basic nutrition needed to grow normally.

Poverty doesn’t just limit choices. It reshapes bodies, lives, and futures.

I also remembered something Sadhguru had mentioned somewhere..... that one third of the food produced in the world gets wasted, while one in nine people don’t have enough to eat. And that this isn’t really a failure of agriculture, but a failure of the human heart

Yesterday reminded me how disconnected our daily worries can be from the harsh realities around us..... and how easy it is to forget that what we call “problems” are often privileges in disguise.

1pooxvh,Depression brain skews self perception,"I know we all know this, but today i found proof for myself. 

  
I was catching up on some group text messages.  When i was done,  for some reason i decided to clean up old text messages in the app i was using.  

  
They were all from a previous job. At some point we switched to Slack so the text messaging stopped.

Before that,  I had about 10 different conversations with different people and a group text with my direct team mates and manager. 

I always had this view of myself that everyone hates me, and that even though I excelled at my job I was still a loser bc i smoked weed back then and had brought a SH thing to HR and was feeling like enemy #1.

  
It was during Covid and we had just transitioned to wfh. 

I noticed something glaring,  which was, contrary to my perception of myself as weak and slacker-like I was actually really proactive.  I messaged people to ask about projects they handed off to me.  I summarized my work days when asked or if everyone was sharing.  

  
I said good morning to my team mates with gifs. 

  
My manager hilighted my achievements and told our team they were proud. 

I placed at the top of my company for a metric for the quarter (and later the year). 

  
There was a time i was having internet issues and someone checked in on me and told me they couldn't see my activity.  I always thought i was meek and would have been like ""So sorry I'm a bootlicker and don't deserve to exist"" 

  
But i was actually like,  ""here's what's going on.  Here are the actions I'm taking. "" 

And people were motivated to reach out and help me.  People even described their problems to me. People told me i was awesome.  

  
It was all right there in text,  totally different than how I imagined myself in that time period. 

  
Going forward I will remember who I actually am. ",33,3,2025-12-17 11:25:45,Impressive-Basket-57,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pooxvh/depression_brain_skews_self_perception/,selfimprovement,0.96,Vent,0.9805,0.1805357142857143,0.0,1,0.33025714285714286,1
1pp7lnt,Saving this for future me,"Three days ago, I uploaded a post in this community about how scared I am to work. I’m truly grateful to everyone who commented. I genuinely appreciate all of you. It reminded me that there are still many good people out there.

Right now, I’m still scared, but I’ve started looking for a job. I asked my brother to help me find one, and now I’m waiting.

Today, I decided to save this post and the other posts I made in different communities. I saw someone on Instagram who saved pictures of himself from the early days of his self-improvement journey. I want to do the same. I’ll save these posts, log out of my Reddit account, and not touch it again, maybe for five years.

Five years from now, I might log back in and see this post. I hope it reminds me how far I’ve come. Maybe I’ll feel satisfied. Maybe nostalgic. Maybe I’ll even cry a little, seeing the distance between who I was and who I became.

I might fail on this journey. I might procrastinate again. Maybe this post is just another excuse, but even so, I’ll try again. I’ll keep trying, for myself and for my mother, who has struggled so much. I promise myself that one day, I’ll retire her and give her a comfortable life.

So this is my last message here. Change is in our hands, it’s up to us how we use it. Just don’t give up.

See you… maybe in five years. Or maybe never. Maybe I’ll forget all about this. But maybe one day, I’ll stumble upon this post again.

See ya.  
Goodbye.

I have realised by mum and my sister that I'm piece of shit towards others by shouting to others when I'm stressed or panicked, I don't learn from others, I shout at others whenever I get snappy whenever people talk to me for no reason. I shout at others just to get want I want without remorse and constantly acting erratic, that mum constantly morns that she misses the nice me and she said today that she kicking me out next year since she tired of constant belittling and my sister agrees.

I feel that I'm selfish that I constantly use emotional manipulation towards others and that I will never learn from my mistakes, it's always people justified opinions or advice to me them I just cry and shout and no one wants a person who constantly acts like this.
 
Today,I realised that I get frustrated at people who want to help me and elevate me such as government workers by shouting and them acting frustrating to towards them and testy and trying procrastinating by delaying everything that mum wants me to help with like bus pass out of laziness and stressed.
I realised that i get too upset and shout and scream whenever people give me critism and not empathetic to others.

My mum said she will be cutting me off next year that means I will be living on due to my selfish actions and that it's impacting her health. 

I'm thinking of working a crappy job like Amazon or factory to discipline me and gain a sense of respect towards others.

I believe that I'm bad and rude person who will hurt others, I don't deserve love at all since that I will people in future and I feel that I'm unable to change at all. No one loves an aggressive person and that I need to have alone live from hurting others.

1poomi0,"I want to become a better, more confident, well-rounded person, but I’m not sure where or how to start","For some context: I’m a 27M and have struggled with anxiety for most of my life. Growing up, I spent most of my time studying, so I didn’t really have much time to socialize, build friendships, or explore interests outside of academics. Because of that, I never developed strong social foundations.

On paper, things look fine. I’m currently working as a doctor (GP), financially stable, have a great relationship with my family, and I’m generally content with life. Socially, though, I feel very behind. I’m awkward around people in social settings (interestingly, I have no issues in professional environments like clinics or hospitals), uncomfortable in crowds, and public speaking is a big challenge for me.

I usually make a good first impression, but things tend to fizzle out after that. I struggle with following up, keeping conversations going, or replying naturally over time, which makes it hard to build or sustain friendships and romantic relationships.

When it comes to dating, I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve been told I’m good looking. I’m 6’1”, fairly well built (I work out regularly), and I do get attention—women have given me their numbers, asked me to call, or even asked me out directly. Colleagues and friends have also shown interest or flirted. Despite all that, I’ve never really reciprocated. Anxiety, fear, and overthinking usually stop me before anything goes anywhere.

Previously, when I was working in a hospital, I was doing 12–14 hour shifts and didn’t have much free time. I was completely focused on work. Now that I’m working as a GP, I suddenly have a lot more free time, and it’s made me reflect on my life. Lately, it has felt very empty. I finish work at 5 pm, go to the gym, then go back home, watch tv/ play videogames, go to bed at 12. Maybe once a week ill go the mall with my sisters. Life feels very monotonous. I don’t want to be sad and lonely at 40, regretting my past and wishing I’d done things differently.

I’m genuinely trying to grow as a person—socially, emotionally, and mentally—and I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who’s been in a similar place or has suggestions on where to start.",27,14,2025-12-17 11:07:22,ArvinTheRaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1poomi0/i_want_to_become_a_better_more_confident/,selfimprovement,0.97,Question,0.9743,0.07299382716049384,-0.5863968729972839,-1,0.013690328933456786,0

1pp2t2k,Any good books (or advice in general) on efficiently changing your mindset?,"So, I have been going through some recommended self-help books and started reading Psycho-Cybernetics. Because of the way it talked about ESP and other pseudo-scientific topics as well as it's religious undertones I abandoned it and watched a youtube summary instead. It did, however, get me thinking about importance of mindset in self-improvement.

Pretty much every self-help book out there follows this formula: ""Most people go through life having A, B, and C limiting beliefs/negative mindset. If you instead cultivate X, Y, and Z empowering beliefs/positive mindset your life will drastically change for the better guaranteed!"" Problem is that over time the excitement of the ideas in the book gradually fades and the ideas in it fail to crystalize as a new mindset.

Now, I have had some success in changing my mindset. Some time ago I have burnt out working 50-60 hour work weeks without vacations for 2 years and quit my job. Since I had savings to live of, I let myself deteriorate to the point where any productive action felt like an insurmountable obstacle. To dig myself out I dived deep into self-help books about self-discipline and adjacent topics. I've read Atomic Habits, Mindful Self-Discipline, Deep Work, Getting Things Done, and a few other less impactful titles.

Advice in them helped me a lot but, for the purpose of the topic, here's what helped shift my mindset:

* Reading on the topic every day for a few months in a row exposed my mind to the ideas consistently long enough that I started thinking in a different way
* Building healthy habits and otherwise gradually increasing my workload as I learned created a positive feedback loop that reinforced the new productive identity I was trying to create
* Introspective exercises in some of the book helped reinforce it further
* By journaling my progress every day, I further strengthened my new mindset through congratulating myself on any successes and consciously kept building it by acknowledging any failures and making plans to succeed in the future

While in the last 3-4 months I've changed a lot for the better, I'm still having trouble thinking of myself as a productive person. While I can finally stick to my routines I still find myself losing focus, find myself in busy traps, have to force myself to do ""scary"" tasks and in general have to fight my lazy side on bad days. I am still gradually chipping away at those but my point is that my productive mindset still has a long way to go.

I have other mindsets that I need to change. For example I have social anxiety. My current ingrained mindset is ""I'm not confident around people because I feel like people are judging everything I say and do."" A healthy mindset would be something along the lines of ""I have every reason to feel confident because I wish people well and whatever happens I can deal with it."" I know it intellectually but I don't feel like it's a part of me and that sabotages it. I need better mindsets for other areas of my life such as relationships, money, professional development, being in control of my emotions, etc. 

It seems that, just like learning to be disciplined, learning to change your mindsets is an essential skill and a part of the foundation of further self-improvement. It just takes too damn long. Are there good books on how to do so efficiently? Or at least any advice on what I'm not already doing? Books like Psycho-Cybernetics seem to advocate practicing visualizations but I have not had good results with these having gone through ""The Secret"" phase years ago with minimal results. I don't know, maybe there's a better way of doing them.

I understand that there's no magic formula that will change my personality overnight but anything that adds direction to and improves efficiency of changing mindsets would be much appreciated.

1po5332,They say your brain can start rewiring in just 3 days so I decided to test it myself.,"I kept hearing that our phones are wrecking our attention, so when I came across a study from Heidelberg University saying the brain can start to adapt after just three days of reduced phone use, it caught my attention. Three days felt manageable. Not a full detox. Not some extreme reset.

I didn’t delete any apps. I just blocked the ones I open mindlessly social media, news, endless scrolling and limited myself to a few intentional check-ins per day. After the third day, something surprising happened: I didn’t feel the urge to go back to how I was using my phone before.

I kept going. My sleep improved. I felt more focused and less mentally noisy. I started reading again, taking evening walks, and noticing how much more present I felt throughout the day. Small changes kept stacking on each other, and replacing scrolling with better habits started to feel natural.

What helped most:

Using an app blocker to add friction

Keeping my phone out of the bedroom at night

Choosing simple replacements like books, walks, and journaling

Framing it as a three-day experiment instead of a permanent change


That short time frame made it feel achievable. I’m about two weeks in now, still using my phone but far more intentionally around 45 minutes to an hour a day on social media instead of constant checking.

So, be optimistic, it pays off 😊",47,5,2025-12-17 04:49:37,andtitov,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pogvnb/be_optimistic_this_is_one_of_the_most_valuable/,selfimprovement,1.0,Tips and Tricks,0.9899,0.40303030303030307,0.9637287259101868,1,0.859440423561154,1

1pouinx,Need advice,"Hi everyone. I’m 27F and I feel like my life is falling apart all at once.

Relationships & loneliness:
For a long time, all I wanted was to get married. Most of my friends are already married, and I felt left behind. Over time, I realized marriage is only as good as the person you marry, so I became more selective. I’m not into superficial things,my only physical preference is height….but I cannot find an emotional connection with anyone.

I’ve tried dating apps and putting myself out there, but nothing clicks. I also tend to analyze people early, judge compatibility quickly, and emotionally pull away. On top of that, every time I’ve been vulnerable and opened up about my struggles, the person eventually left.

Health & relationships:
I’ve had health issues since childhood and have had surgeries. When I share this with men I date, especially when they think about the future, they often leave. They see me good enough for short term which is not what i want.I told myself I’d be fine on my own, but I’m realizing I’m not.

No support system:
This is the part that’s breaking me the most. I don’t have a real support system.
When I have a bad day, I have no one to go to.
When something good happens, I have no one to tell.

Recently, I had a couple of job interviews, and I realized I didn’t even have a single person I could say, “This is where I’ll be, just in case something happens.” That realization completely broke me.

Even the friendships I have feel shallow. They’re just there. I’ve never opened up to them about my problems.

Mental health & moving countries:
I moved countries hoping it would change my life or help me heal. Instead, everything I thought I had healed from came back much worse. Living alone has intensified everything, and I’ve started isolating myself even more.

Work, studies & fear:
I got fired from one job and I’m scared I’ll get fired from my current one too. My performance is low, I barely communicate, and I feel like I just exist at work.

I’m supposed to be working on my final project but can’t focus. I’m also supposed to be job hunting, but I haven’t even made a resume because I’m terrified of rejection. I feel stuck in a self-sabotage loop.

Daily life & emotional state:
I’ve lost motivation completely. No routine, messy room, barely eating, spending most days in bed. The spark is gone. I feel empty, numb, and exhausted. I pray and cry myself to sleep most nights, knowing I need to change things but not knowing how.",3,5,2025-12-17 17:15:20,Beneficial-Tour-8508,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pouinx/need_advice/,selfimprovement,0.81,Vent,-0.9885,0.07931839402427639,-0.8129700422286987,-1,-0.6871713423094941,-1

1pp2ra6,Anyone else feel like they can’t live until they’re “settled”? How do you break this?,"I’ve realized I might have something like conditional self-worth and I’m trying to improve it.

Whenever I feel like dating, socializing, or just doing fun things, a voice in my head stops me and says: “You’re not settled yet. No stable job. Not enough money.” So I end up postponing relationships and enjoyment until some future version of me feels “ready.”

Logically, I know being “settled” is a moving target. There’s always another milestone. But emotionally, I still feel like I don’t have permission to live fully until I reach it.

I don’t want to lose my ambition — I just don’t want my entire life on pause until some future checkpoint.

For people who’ve dealt with this:

How did you loosen this mindset without becoming complacent?

Any practical ways to balance self-improvement with actually living?

Did discuss about this topic with someone and they said : This happens to People from financial uncertainty (or who fear it) Even if money wasn’t extremely scarce, You felt instability or comparison

1porlmf,any advice for overnight workers?,"i spent a year looking for a new job that included benefits. the only one i could find that would take me on was a walmart associate position as a full time night shift stocker. 

i still work for the city library as a part time aide in the morning after i get off my night shift, and the only free time i have tuesday-saturday is reserved for sleep (2pm-9pm). 

my weekends are always chaotic because i get off at 7am on sunday, which is the day i reserve for socializing. then, monday is my other day off and i try to fill it with important stuff like cleaning, writing, walking, and sleeping. but, my sleep schedule is still bouncing all over the place, my diet is hard to control because i can never remember when the last time i ate was. also my motivation to create/write has gone down a lot because im tired so often, and you can forget about dating lol. 

i’m working at the library so that i can get an entire year under my belt and hopefully apply for a full-time position when one opens up. i’m working at walmart because i have to right now. there really isn’t an option for me to quit, unless i start applying to other jobs again (which i’ll start doing this weekend to be honest). 

it’s just disheartening knowing that i worked hard for my degree, worked hard to fix my sleep schedule, worked hard to create healthy habits for myself to overcome depression; and now i feel like i have no control over anything. i know i still have control and it’s all about mindset and resilience, but i think some advice would be helpful. thanks.

1porx36,what is wrong with me :(,"Today I made a small mistake by cutting a granola packet incorrectly, and it upset my dad. He expressed concern about why I struggle with simple tasks and described me as disorganized. While I didn’t want to use my mental health as an excuse, I explained that I wasn’t feeling like myself today. The situation escalated to the point where he lost his appetite and raised concerns about how this behaviour might affect me in the workplace, as well as his reputation and connections. This made me reflect deeply on my past mistakes. I am genuinely trying to understand what’s going on with me and to improve myself.

2024 was an extremely difficult year for me academically, financially, and emotionally. Things became so overwhelming that I was admitted to a psychiatric ward following a suicide attempt, and I had to take a year off university to focus on healing and rebuilding my life. During this time, I was struggling with severe mental health challenges and unhealthy emotional attachments, which I am still actively working through in therapy.

On the academic and financial side, I was funded by a government bursary but lost it because my family’s income was slightly above the threshold. As my mental health deteriorated, I struggled to focus, missed assignments, and performed poorly. I was experiencing persistent suicidal ideation and was later diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety. I am now in the process of transferring to another institution, which requires going through a readmission process. Recently, being rejected by my dream university triggered a lot of anger and disappointment within my family. This was followed by unrelated issues being brought up, such as failing my driver’s licence test twice, which they paid for. Additionally, my entire family—including my younger sister—was upset with me for losing my mom’s phone, even though it was replaced. When I tried to express my emotions and cried, I was told I was being dramatic and that, at 21, I should be “strong enough to handle things.”

I have taken responsibility for my actions and apologised where necessary. Regarding the phone incident, I wasn’t fully aware of my surroundings at the time—I stepped out of the car to buy groceries and my attention was fixated on that. I am actively working on bettering myself every day, and I acknowledge
 that I will make mistakes again. The issue is not a lack of accountability—I have taken it. However, continuing to shame and repeatedly punish me for past mistakes does not help me heal, grow, or move forward. While my family has the right to feel upset, constant criticism only makes recovery and self-improvement more difficult.",3,10,2025-12-17 14:32:19,forestviolette,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1porx36/what_is_wrong_with_me/,selfimprovement,1.0,Question,-0.9978,-0.07484030197444833,-0.8522618412971497,-1,-0.7404389810434645,-1

Every time it blows up in my face. Every time, and I cannot learn from these mistakes at all. The only time I actually do something is if I am in panic mode and anxiety overwhelms my mind. 

Except if I am not threatened by being fired or expelled, I do not do anything. If the thing is low-stakes but nonetheless important, I absolutely do nothing even if I am panicking. I find distractions to calm myself down.

1potflj,Where can I go from here?,"Anyone who can be arsed, please tell me straight! Where can I (32F) go from here?

My upbringing was chaotic and I experienced neglect, abuse, and abandonment, blah blah blah.

I've been on a self improvement journey for 8 years since a close friend died by suicide and his dad sat with me and we wrote a list of goals. These goals were to work looking after elderly people and to work with dogs.

I went and did that, working as a carer and a dog walker at the same time, along with 6 other part time jobs. All these jobs because I was single, have no family, and have a dog and a horse to keep.

I stopped working as a carer due to the issues with pay (only being paid for the time at the persons house, not for driving, so I was working double the time I was earning for and couldn't afford to do that) and then lockdown meant I was suddenly without income from my other jobs, so I became a tree surgeon, which I did for 3 years. My grandmother paid for me to do the training courses and bought me a cheap 4x4 when I was a year in. Throughout the first 5 years of this I was working 60-80 hour weeks, sometimes working 5 jobs a day and rarely having a day off. I thought working = self improvement.

During my tree surgery career my mum died and I inherited around £100k. I tried to reconnect with my dad for support, none forthcoming. I took a year out due to burnout. Then I spent £5k of my inheritance on a mentorship program to be a dog trainer, turned over £30k in my first year, again working long hours. During the middle of this business my grandmother died, my last remaining grandparent. Over the next 6 months I burnt out again with mental health issues coming to the foreground. 4 years later I have £4k left. During these 8 years I've moved house 18 times.

I live with my partner of 9 months, who currently pays all the bills. We knew each other for a year before we got together, and got together while I was still running my business. He wants a family but I don't feel safe to as I have no family and his parents are toxic. I also have a mistrust for healthcare professionals and doubt my own ability to be a parent and not mess up my children. I also have concerns about finances - we could afford children, but at the expense of any hobbies or extra-curricular activities, and what is the point of creating lives that can't have fun or realise their potential with something they love? Our relationship is likely to end if I decide I don't want children. I won't be able to afford my horse if I choose to have children, nor will I be able to afford him if I choose to leave. More to the point, I would have to work out how to afford myself.

I have very poor financial literacy, qualifications in tree surgery and animal care which are both very low pay, a car, and a lot of friends who would put me up for limited times in various parts of the country. I've been in this position before and I'm not thrilled to be looking at the potential of it again.

1poen0q,Staying at home to protect my parents financially vs moving out to grow as a person,"I live in London and study at uni here, about a 45-minute commute from home.

Because of finances, I’ve stayed living at home and commuting. If I really pushed, my parents could help me move out, but it would put them under genuine financial strain. They’d do it without hesitation, but they’d struggle. I’m not comfortable asking for that, even if it means sacrificing what I want.

At the same time, I feel stuck. Living at home feels like it’s holding me back mentally and emotionally. I don’t have much space to think clearly, build good habits, or work properly on myself outside of just getting through uni. I genuinely believe having my own place would help me grow, take more responsibility, and focus better on uni, personal development, and trying to build something on the side.

What makes it harder is that most of my close friends live out in London. Their families are much better off, so moving out was never a moral dilemma for them. I try not to compare, but it does make me feel like I’m falling behind in independence and adulthood.

I’m stuck between two options:

* stay at home, protect my parents financially, but accept feeling stagnant
* move out, gain independence and headspace, but live with the guilt of adding pressure to them

how would you guys think about this decision? Is short-term discomfort worth long-term independence, or is patience and restraint the real growth here?",9,27,2025-12-17 03:17:06,skx888,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1poen0q/staying_at_home_to_protect_my_parents_financially/,selfimprovement,1.0,Question,0.9861,0.16238244514106584,-0.5804226994514465,1,0.03809513930248987,0

For some reason I'll have random days where I'm filled with confidence in my self-improvement journey and I do everything to the higher standards which I want with no issues.

But I find the second I go to bed and wake up the next day, all that energy and positive self-action is gone. Replaced by the version of lackluster self from the day before.

I had this happen twice last week. I spent many hours throughout the night working on a project and I felt extremely proud. I go to sleep and then the next day I didn't care anymore. I went back to my old habits, started eating like shit again, etc.

I realized just now, I really don't understand why this happens. It's like I burn out after one day and go back to my default, and I hate it. And this shit has been happening for years now that I think of it.

How do I stop this. How do I go from random bursts of energy to consistent dicipline?

I’m having a hard time I’ve been trying to date for about 3-4 months and in that time I have met 2 women who I deem to be really really good matches to me. I’ve matched with more and all that but they each have had deal breakers early on for me.

I’m rather picky so when I find someone I vibe with I feel like it’s like meeting someone who’s a whole different type of human. Like a new breed of individual…

I don’t know what to do I obviously have a problem and it seems like I don’t know how to tackle it so I’m reaching out for some advice.

I’m still friends with the first woman but she pretty much hard friendzoned me with no reasoning (she’s not one to communicate her feelings unless needed) and I actually just reached out trying to get a better understanding.

But anyways in the end I’m asking for help on how to not get attached and take things casually, and how to recover from this and prevent it from happening over and over.

Edit…. I actually talked to the first girl that I mentioned in this post and I bawled my eyes out, she basically told me that I was perfect and everything she wanted but she had a dealbreaker which was that I was engaged before.

1pof11x,"Spent the last 4 months in solitude, trying to heal. It feels like my life is finally starting to begin at age 27. How do you know when to leave solitude, and acclimate back to the real world?","
Around 4 months ago, I moved out on my own. I left a pretty bad situation with my father. I had been paying the bills, and he was taking my money to fuel his addiction. 

Before that, I lived with my mom and stepdad. My stepfather was not a nice man, to put it mildly… I fled physical abuse, just to end up living with emotional and financial abuse. And growing up, I was severely obese, so as you can imagine, kids were terrible to me in school…that led into my own drug addiction that I slowly saved myself from. 

Long story short, for the first time in my life, I’m living in total peace. No one is hitting me, screaming at me, making fun of me, stealing my money, or doing drugs in my home. It’s total peace. 

I don’t know why, but I just feel this need to be alone, even though I don’t want to be. I never leave my house, unless it’s for work. I’m an EMT, and I work one 24-hour shift, and one 16 hour shift a week. The rest of the time, I’m sitting alone. 

For the past 4 months, I’ve spent the majority of my time alone. I didn’t want to, but I feel like I needed to. But now, I don’t know how to return back to normal life. I’ve tried really hard to heal. I meditate, and cry when I need to. I’ve had conversations with both my dad and stepdad, who both apologized to me. I’ve read books, cooked nutritious meals, slept a lot, and had good conversations with friends. 

I really want to travel the world. I’ve never fallen in love before, and can’t wait to get that chance. How do you know if you’re ready for that? 

How do you know when you’re ready to start a new life? It feels like my life is finally beginning at age 27…

How do you know when it’s time to leave solitude, and go back into the real world?

For some reason I keep failing, sometimes it is just a few days in, other times it was a few weeks to a month in. 

I am so frustrated that I keep letting my intrusive thoughts win, and it scares me because I am running out of time to catch up in life and achieving basic milestones. 

It also doesn’t help that everyone in my life has something going for them without them having to put in any effort at all. We all know that self improvement never really crosses the minds of normal people who are able to naturally achieve things.

1pogmol,Anger and rage make me feel terrible but I continue doing it,"Well back story on how I learned I had anger issues. So, it was kindergarten, this kid being a kid was bagging and bothering me, I got fade up, picked up a sharp pencil and poked him in the head, he bled out badly. The worst part is that I didn’t say sorry when I was requested to.

I continued struggling with getting angry very quickly all through out my teenage years and even now in my early twenties I still struggle with being a ticking time bomb. It’s like I always feel my start racing, my chest gets set on fire, I start shivering every time I get angry. 

Then fast forward to my recent encounter that I kind of regret. So, I’m a newly enrolled masters student and I live in student accommodation near the campus. And well we have rules the accommodation regarding the closing hours of the gates. I follow these rules religiously but one this one night I needed to pick up some food I ordered, this was at 1am btw. Well fast forward, I leave the gates, and I informed the guard before hand that I was going to pick up something near by and that I will be back in a sec, he said it’s cool so I leave. Then boom, I got back after like 3 minutes, so surprisingly this man stopped me, even though other people were entering freely, so I comply and ask him what’s happening, he tells me it’s nothing much and that he just needs my student card, so I’m like cool, I hand it to him. Then he tells me to carry on and go to my room, then me confused, I asked him why he’s holding on to my card, he gives me no proper reason, I then proceeded to tell him that I need my card because I can’t enter the main campus without it.

He then laughs and tells me that’s none of his business. This immediately triggers me because I now thought he was playing games. We had a back and forth conversation and then out of nowhere, this other guy who’s just a mere nobody comes to interfere and asked me why I was talking to the guard like that, I respectfully told him that had nothing to do with him and I guess he felt a certain way about it. Then boom the guy starts pushing and shoving me out of nowhere. 

Then boom, I got so enraged, swang and slapped the shit out of him. He dropped to the floor and started bleeding out his mouth. Well long story short is that my card got confiscated and took to the administration now yay 😒. I know all of this was avoidable but the question is how? How do I deal with my anger because it’s so not worth it at all.

1pofw7y,Finals Cooldown,"I've recently had to run through a final series of assignments from my college. I go to community college full time with five classes and go to work full time as well to balance it out. I drive to class at least two hours there and back for three days a week, I work mornings and I come home late from my classes. 

I had maybe 4 essay assignments requiring more than 1,000 words, more than 10 smaller writing assignments and quizzes and three exams. I'm getting my last two exams done this week but ever since then, I've noticed how drained, unmotivated and overall sad I have become.

I haven't been able to focus on my passions but even then when I get the chance, I don't want to do it. 

  
Is there anyway to fix this? I fear that I'm going to stay like this for a while and I don't know what to do.

1pokhic,I thought I was lazy and unmotivated. Turns out I might have been overstimulated.,"For a long time, I genuinely believed something was wrong with me.

I couldn’t focus. starting tasks felt heavy. even things I wanted to do felt pointless. I kept telling myself I just needed more discipline or motivation.

The confusing part was this:
I wasn’t depressed. My life was objectively fine. but everything felt flat. Like my brain was tired before the day even started.

Over the past months, I noticed how constantly stimulated I was phone first thing in the morning, background noise all day, switching tasks every few minutes. No real pauses. No silence.

When I slowly reduced the noise (not quitting everything, just lowering the volume), something unexpected happened:
focus came back a little.
starting felt less painful.
simple things felt rewarding again.

I’m still figuring this out and I don’t have a perfect system. But it made me question whether a lot of what we call laziness is actually just mental overstimulation.

I’m curious:
Have any of you experienced something similar?
Did reducing stimulation help your self-improvement journey, or was it something else entirely?",0,1,2025-12-17 07:35:33,EventNo9425,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pokhic/i_thought_i_was_lazy_and_unmotivated_turns_out_i/,selfimprovement,0.4,Question,0.7454,0.0042968750000000056,-0.8345662951469421,-1,-0.1928037725734711,0
1po87ci,How do I stop needing validation for everything,"I'm 18 now but I've always been a shy kid and struggled with self-esteem too. I've worked on it a lot and I'm not a hundred percent yet and that's okay. But I've still not figured out how to not need validation.
When I was younger I thought I wasn't attractive and I was fine with it. But around 13-14, suddenly boys started liking me and it was exhilarating. I felt pretty and since then if someone didn't find me pretty it would make me question everything. At that age I was even a pick-me. I'm not embarrassed to admit that because I was aware enough to recognize it and fix it at that same age because it was just ugly.

But lately just when I thought I was making progress progress I realized it was even worse. I don't care about looks anymore but I dug deeper and see that I crave validation in other forms too. One being academic validation but I guess a lot of students have that. What bothers me is even trivial choices need validation. If someone doesn't like the book I like it makes me think I have bad taste or I'm somehow wrong. I never feel good enough because whatever I choose someone will be able to criticise it. Something my friends have noticed in me is that I always need to be right and get defensive when approached because someone disagreeing with me feels like the end of the world. If someone doesn't like me I feel like I have to explain myself or 'sell' myself to them. It's just so annoying atp. And ik I need to work on them and half of the things I mentioned have improved significantly with time and I've actually gotten compliments for being confident and smart but I often feel like I'm faking it. 
So if anybody else going through or got over this, I would appreciate some words of wisdom.

1pnv40q,How do you like yourself if you’re unlikable?,"I, like many people, have been told to love myself. I figure, hey, if enough people say it there’s gotta be something to it. I just don’t understand it on a practical level. How am I supposed to love myself? How does one do it if they should happen to be a deeply unpleasant person? I really truly do not understand but would like to. 

As a child I was a dishonest, selfish, weak-willed, annoying, whiny, self indulgent and deeply cringe. I was bad at sports and didn’t play an instrument. My grades were whatever. Should I have loved myself then?

In my teens I was all of the above but add in being amoral and rude should I have loved myself then? 

Now I’m in my 20s and as I’m sure you’ve noticed I’m a self pitying loser. No one likes those who go about in pity for themselves. It’s almost universally recognized as a gross thing. I could have become better but I haven’t which in and of itself makes me less likable. 

Now, notice then that none of the versions of myself past or present was likable. If a fictional character was based on me as a child, or as a teen, or as an adult, the result would be the same. That character would be utterly reviled by the fandom of whatever work they were in. People would absolutely loathe those characters because they’re boring and useless. Why would anyone enjoy a character who has the traits I described?

So considering that, how do I make myself like myself without utterly deluding myself with positivity?

1po2qym,How can I improve the disconnect between my image and actions,"So i am a very friendly and make well with everyone kind of a person, i am although very sharp and always give people the idea that i am very outspoken. That is not true, I am a serial people pleaser so I let people walk all over me and let them off with them ever apologising or feeling remorse.

Recently a colleague shouted at me because I knocked something over and he got extra mad because he though I was mad, but I genuinely was just somewhere else.

He was very very loud and it made me realise he has done this countless times and that he has no respect towards me.

I am also constantly spoken over when I speak or put upfront an idea, or he casually starts proving and explaining i am wrong about something i spoke amongst others, even though he agreed with the said thing behind closed doors.

I talked with him about this, he got defensive and well I did it so I can tell him that this was not okay and moving forward we'll be speaking for if work requires.

So what I want to really learn is how to treat people like people, not gods or rather how to be simply distant and lukewarm but tactful with people

I am severely untactful person, which is why my image is harsh and of a outspoken and angry person but it's the opposite in action. :\

1po4sww,I thought self-improvement was about discipline - turns out it was about questioning my own thoughts,"For a long time, I treated self-improvement like a performance issue. If I wasn’t improving, I assumed I just wasn’t trying hard enough. More willpower, better habits, stricter routines - that was always the answer.

What I didn’t question was the voice in my head narrating everything I did.

Things like:

“You’re behind.”

“You should be better by now.”

“This probably won’t work anyway.”

“Other people have it figured out - you don’t.”

Those thoughts felt true, so I built my behavior around them. And honestly, no amount of discipline works very well when it’s built on assumptions you’ve never checked.

Reading 7 Lies Your Brain Tells You: And How to Outsmart Every One of Them helped me see that a lot of these thoughts aren’t insight - they’re habits. The brain repeats familiar stories to keep things predictable, even if those stories quietly sabotage progress.

What’s changed for me isn’t motivation, it’s awareness. When I notice a thought like “this isn’t worth starting,” I don’t argue with it - I just stop treating it like a fact. That alone has made improvement feel less exhausting and more sustainable.

1po4b7h,Vulnerability Is A Strength,"Whether you're struggling with anxiety, emotional turmoil or navigating a challenging situation, I promise you vulnerability is a big part of the answer.

  
If you've ever wanted to help someone you know is going through a hard time and wished they'd open up more, then you know how frustrating it is when they close the door on you.

  
When you’re trying to help others, you can see a clearer picture as you’re largely detached from the emotion and complexity of thoughts the person is feeling.

  
I guarantee there's been a time when you've missed your own opportunity to be vulnerable instead of getting the help you need. Big or small.



To capture the key points of the post here:

1) Aversion - You avoid vulnerability because you are running from your emotions or running from reality

2) Emotional Wreck - Being vulnerable is not an outpouring of emotion. It's more an open expression. Just getting out of your own head is a big step.

3) Seeking - Vulnerability is often less about what is going wrong and more about what's missing. The emotion of the situation that you're seeking is often harder to express than the sharp clarity of negative emotions.

5) Vulnerability is Weakness - stop pretending you've got everything worked out. I'd rather have weaknesses that I'm working on, than being negligent to weaknesses under the guise of strength.

5) Self-Vulnerability - You can start by being vulnerable to yourself. Name and express emotions openly. Just give yourself some clarity (there's an infographic on this in the article)

6) Pose Questions - If you're afraid of over-sharing, just pose questions about the situation so it doesn't feel so personal and their answers are equally open (so they don't 'hurt' you)

7) Richer Relationships - if you want depth of relationships, be vulnerable with people. It works both ways, and you'll realise other's vulnerability makes for great life lessons.

8) Pride - Don't let your pride or misguided sense of determination stop you from being vulnerable in a way that matters.

I am an intermediate gym bro. Went to the gym for four years, 2 years were useless, but I taught myself a lot from research, the third year was phenomenal, fourth year, I went to calisthenics,s and shit stagnated.



After I did boxing, got sick, lost a lot of weight, gained it back, and now I am at 86kg. I want to bulk up to 96kg and cut to 93kg.



I am going to do a 6 times per week push, pull, legs split, 4k kcal, 215g of protein, and a higher fat diet because I feel better on it. The 4k kcal sounds a lot, but I did 3.6k and stayed on the same weight, so f#\*k that.



The past three weeks, I have been going to the gym on a 4-day upper-lower split, where I was in the gym for 3h each time, 3.6k kcal, 200g of protein, and I am on the same weight now.

Been experiencing some isolation and distancing from some of my friends/group recently and idk why i even to this.

But come to think of it its make sense sometimes to me, particularly ""being a floater friend"" now i dont even do this Intentionally to hurt myself or for  attention but i always notice that when sometimes i hangout with them it just feels off being with them like literally im just a floater there.
They have secrets of there own, call signs, events, etcs.. i used to hangout with them while having fun, enjoying the moment, going through places/events you know the stuff where friends go.

But this recently hits me like some of my personal (like old/real) friends ive been with there just have a thing with there other friends.
And ive also think like sometimes in the group im the giver not the receiver type of thing but i received from them to but it really feels off now.

Now i dont have a grudge on them (maybe a little bit) whenever i see them hangout without me (sometimes having no invite typical thing) but i respect that because i understand that sometimes my i dont need to be there like not all the time my presence needs to be there. But I've come to the point that i really just need to have time to myself redeeming myslef. I just use it as my motivation as to improve myslef.

However, this going back to my home country makes me feel like a failure… like I don’t have any family of my own and it’s not like I’ve made millions of dollars or I got a really good position in the company. 

I don’t know why I feel this way… I’ve done my best and my health isn’t so good right now and I’d rather be close to my family… this feeling of a total failure feels like real. I know it’s some make up crap in my head :(

1pntwih,Need some tips to tackle deep seated superiority complex and insecurities attached to them,"Now that 2025 is coming to an end, I had been planning out for the upcoming year and what milestones I want to reach while also introspecting certain emotions I have been experiencing lately. 

I observed that I would get a sense of superiority when I saw others failing to lead a disciplined lifestyle while I am actively trying my best to lead a good life. If I meet someone who is trying to do a same thing as I am, I try to compare our output. 

Example: I have been feeling proud of the fact that I have been going to gym regularly and not 'giving up on my gym subscription like other people'. Then I see people of my age being equally motivated to continue their gym routine and suddenly my inferiority complex kicks in because I feel like I am not doing good and my superiority complex would simultaneously come out of the woodwork trying to cope with that fact by trying to nitpick others.

This is just one example but I believe I have felt this emotion whenever I feel like I am proud of something that I have done or achieved. My perfectionist self would see others and start attacking my own small victories.

I should be feeling proud of other people's journey without trying to belittle others (and especially myself).

1pnf4yj,Turned 29 today. Life hits different. Making myself accountable for the next 365 days.,"I turned 29 today, and honestly, life feels different now.

I’m a senior software developer. I’ve earned enough to buy my parents a home in Mumbai and a small property for their retirement. From the outside, things look “set”. But inside, I know I can do much better as a man, son, partner, and professional.

So I’m making this post to hold myself accountable for the next **365 days**. I’m posting here because this subreddit is about real self-improvement, not motivation quotes.

Habits I am removing:

1. **Relapsing / giving up** when things get hard. No more quitting mentally.
2. **Giving money to friends** and calling it help. I’ve learned the hard way - it comes with regret.
3. **Telling people how much I earn.** Silence builds peace.
4. **Family drama.** No more getting pulled into fights with my mom, dad, or my younger brother (he’s preparing for government exams and needs support, not noise).
5. **Over-talking.** I’m naturally extroverted, but now I want to speak less and act more - calm, focused, disciplined (yes, inspired by Tommy Shelby).

Habits & goals I am committing to:

1. **Gym discipline (365 days mindset).**
   * Get visible 6-pack abs
   * Squat: 80 kg → 160 kg
   * Bench press: 50 kg → 100 kg
   * Leg press: 220 kg → 350 kg (I’ve been training for 3 years, minimum 3 days/week — now it’s about seriousness.)
2. **Clear ₹68 lakh loan** on a shop property I bought for my parents.
3. **Get a job in Australia.** My fiancée is going there for her master’s, and her parents want a guy settled with a job there.
4. **Build a small house** in my village hometown.
5. **Break into a Big-4 / top tech company.** Currently interviewing with Microsoft and LinkedIn.
6. **Marry the woman I’ve loved since school**, with her father’s blessing.

I’m not posting this to flex. I’m posting this so that one year from now, I can look back and say I didn’t waste my 29th year.

If you’ve done something similar - a public accountability post, a one-year personal oath - I’d love to hear:

* What helped you stay consistent?
* What mistakes should I avoid?

1pn9p6h,I feel hopeless about my future,"       21 f.  

 I have ADD, (attention deficit disorder), GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder), and MDD (Major Depressive Disorder.) I had mental health problems as a teen. I feel sorta hopeless and anxious about my future. I want to be completely independent, but everything is so expensive now adays, I may not be able to afford to live on my own. Rent is in the hundreds and thousands these days. Houses are super expensive, they cost thousands of dollars. (I live with my dad right now.) I could theoretically get a roommate, but how would I move my stuff out? And even if I did, I don’t have a car, the roommates place would need to be near a bus stop, I live in Fond Du Lac right now, their aren’t really too many bus stops here, a little bit of walking is required. (And it gets COLD and very snowy, like feet’s of snow here in the winter, like in the 20’s or below.) Luckily it’s not that big a town but still. I mean, I can take Uber sometimes, but… And I worry that even if I got one, they wouldn’t be trustworthy and we wouldn’t get along. Or if they were a guy, etc. I’ve read lots of horror stories of women getting assaulted by male roommates that’s why Im afraid to get one that is a stranger to me. (Or if he like got a crush on me or something, that would be awkward.)  I just have an ordinary not very special job. My last job was at a Goodwill and I was only making $224. I never went to college or anything after high school. I don’t know what it costs but it’s probably expensive too. A car would be cool, but I don’t see a way I could get one or afford one right now. Cars need insurance and whatever else. Unless someone rich got me one or I get married to someone with more money than I’m making, but how likely is that to happen to me? Not everyone finds “the one” during their lifetime. It’s just not 1973 anymore, shit is expensive.

I’m a male freshman in college, autistic, high likeliness of ADHD that the doctors say but won’t try to treat, and I’m on lexapro for chronic anxiety.
I am unfortunately a not as good as a person as I’d like to be. I rely on shock humor in my very few attempts to be humorous, which ended up being sexist, and ableist(maybe even racist?), which just ruined a friendship with a whole group(made them uncomfortable, I guess they voted to block me over the last night), and it’s not the first time something similar has happened. I’m manipulative as far as I’m aware,
Im lazy, entitled, and I keep ruining the good things I have in life.
I also just make people uncomfortable. 
And I can’t also help wondering, how much of this is in my control? Is it me or my medication? 
Is there another root I’m not seeing that’s making me an actively worse person? And it just manifests into a guilt that physically hurts… 
I can apologize and change for a time, but then I revert back. I’m my own worst enemy and I’m struggling to find a way to stop it. 
What’s worse is that I’m not sure I can internalize any of the advice you give me. That it will in one ear and out another. That I’ll be stuck in this loop of self loathing and never learning. 
I hurt the people I care about and yet I can’t change. 
Was it how I was raised? Can I not change? I feel like I need a dialogue tree to even be a good person.

I know it sounds dramatic, but it genuinely affects me. I overthink interactions, replay conversations, and let their moods or opinions ruin my week. What makes it worse is that I know I have a good life. I have a lot going for me and should be enjoying it, yet these specific people (who I can’t cut out because they’re family) still have way too much power over how I feel.

1pnkzqs,"How do you all ""Stop avoiding and start healing""?","A few months ago i came to the revelation that for the past 11 years i haven't really been healing per say i've been ""avoiding""

Without going into a wall of text. After graduating uni in 2014 i was emotionally spent; basically a husk. The only friends i had where around 150/200 miles away so not exactly easy to say ""Hey i'm feeling kinda crappy tonight can i pop round for some company""

So i did the only thing i felt like i could do. Throw myself into the working world, and it worked for a solid 9/10 years. However in the past year (Whilst also being in therapy i might add) i realised that for the majority of my life outside of therapy sessions i have been avoiding the pain and insecurities rather than trying to heal them. I routinley use hobbies and work to ... well avoid feeling the pain. Or to distance myself enough from it where i'm able to look at it from a safe distance as it were

However i now find myself at an impasse where i know what i need to do but no clue how to actually start doing it

I've only recently started with my new therapist (As in i had my first session with the new therapist less than a week ago). So for the next little while at least until they got brought up to speed i need to do a lot of self guided and self disaplined work to do

Striving to really live life to the fullest, and I cant do that trapped with my parents. I feel as though I wasted a lot of time in my 20’s but it’s time for me to be active, disciplined, and really dive into the world. 

I’m currently paying off CC debt, and I should be done by beginning of Feb! I plan on living with some friends for a while until I can afford to move out. 

I do need a car, though that’s something i’ll probably deal with once im there cause i cant really afford one atm. Job wise I don’t really have anything lined up, nor do I have any particular skills or knowledge. My biggest attributes are leadership, child services, people person / amazing customer service, team based settings, retail but would like to escape that territory. Any skills you’d recommend I learn to help land jobs? Or better lifestyle in general?

I’m in ok health, don’t do weed as much as I used to, semi fit, working out bad eating habits. I definitely am on the lazier side on my days off which I want to eliminate but dont get it twisted im a very hard worker no matter what job i have.

1pnfuhw,"Feeling empty, need help","Can't even cry, I feel empty inside

I've been unemployed for one year and a half. I quit because I was burnt out, doing the job of three people without a raise. A friend of mine told me to stay with her in a foreign country for three months, we were best friends (or so I thought). I finally quit and consulted with her if I could still stay three months before doing the decision and she confirmed me that yes. But then, when the date arrived, she told me I couldn't stay so long, only one month. Fine, I got charged $300 for the change in the plane tickets. I arrived there, my friend has a boyfriend and spent most of the time with him. We went to the places we planed together, but she complained most of the trip, or didn't even talk to me, going to sit somewhere else and listen to music. 

Went back to my home country. I accepted the fact that I didn't fit in her life and that I lost my job because of this decision. With my savings dimmed, I started to look for a job and continued studying to get a different job, and have more opportunities. Nothing. 

My parents are wonderful, I have a supportive boyfriend and a really good best friend here. But I can't seem to be happy anymore. I have a masters degree, I've been studying hard since school, learning new things. Everytime I go to an interview I give my best, I even took some advicing from professionals and told me I did good. But then nothing, not even feedback. 

I tried to focus on other things, drawing, thinking about doing YouTube or freelancing but I don't find the energy to do it. I've tried reading about self help and even Buddhism, but nothing. I used to go to therapy, but the sessions are really expensive. 

I just want to cry, and cry and cry until there's nothing left. I am ashamed of telling my family how to feel, because I feel like I can't complain. And my bf I think is getting sick of me, he just hugs me and says everything's going to be alright, but doesn't give me much more advice. I've been crying for two days and feeling hollowed for maybe a week. I thought this feeling would go away as always, but I feel it rooted in me. 

I can't find joy in anything. I don't see a point of moving forward, is there anything there for me? I don't think so. I feel like if I wasn't here nothing would change. My friends would move on soon and my parents wouldn't have to see her oldest child be a burden to them. So I need advice. I know the proper thing is to go seek for therapy, but what can I do to even want to leave the house? To stop crying and feeling like this? I don't know what I need. 

Thank your for reading

1pn2eqi,when was the last time you talked to a stranger?,"okay so we had to do this thing in my college at masters union, where... we had to just… talk. that was it. no task, no deliverable. just talk to people we don’t know.  

so i started walking around and honestly had no idea what i was doing. then i ended up near this uncle making omelettes on the street. stood there for a bit. then we started talking. one thing led to another and he was showing me how he seasons, how long the pan should sit, when to flip.

somehow i was helping him cook. then we were serving people. maybe 10–15. it didn’t feel planned. or awkward or ashamed. or like a “college activity”. it was just… normal.

kinda weird how we almost never do this anymore. like actually talk to someone random without a reason.

i feel like if you’re doing business, trying to make friends, or even just moving to a new place/country, this is such a small thing you can do. talking to rickshawalas, your barber, shopkeepers. some days you learn something new, some days you end up teaching something. either way it feels… grounding.",20,5,2025-12-15 14:00:15,YogurtIll4336,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pn2eqi/when_was_the_last_time_you_talked_to_a_stranger/,selfimprovement,0.96,Other,0.8435,-0.021328671328671316,0.0,0,0.24878426573426574,1
1pmtq4r,I want to turn my life around but I don't know where to start,"I'm a 27 year old woman. I don't have a job. I live at home still. I don't have any education past secondary school. I'm pretty much the definition of a loser. I'm on disability benefits because my mental health prevents me from doing so much. I have seen numerous mental health professionals and been on various meds since I was around 12 years old. I have diagnosed EUPD (previously misdiagnosed as depression), anxiety, ADHD and PMDD.

The PMDD still makes me not want to be alive anymore for a week or so every month but apart from that, with the medication I'm on now, I'm relatively emotionally stable for the first time ever. I see an occupational therapist once a week but there's only so much that can help. I'm on a waiting list for DBT. But with all that being said, I think the main problem is myself really.

I'm studying accounting online but it's going terribly because I'm barely working on it. I could blame my mental health and make excuses, but really I think it's because I have no self discipline at all. I never really stick with anything. I don't even know where to begin with fixing that.

Honestly I rely far too much on my mum and I feel pretty pathetic to be this way as a grown woman. I take excellent care of my pet but can barely take care of myself. I've always been dependent on other people, including boyfriends. This has been my first year single since I was 17 years old because I had 2 long term relationships with very little time between them. I've never been on my own before, so now I'm making a conscious effort to stay out of relationships until I'm happy with my life. I don't really have much life skills. I think I have a bit of learned helplessness and I really don't want to be this way anymore.

I've always had the mindset of ""I can't do this"" and it's keeping me stuck. Having been mentally ill for my entire life, it's become part of my identity. I've always looked at other people living life and hitting milestones and thought ""that's what happens for other people, not for me."" I'm sick of that. I'm sick of getting in my own way. I want to enjoy life too.

I want an education, a job, and to move out. I want to travel. I want to be independent. I'm sick of wasting my life. Everyone around me has a career, they're starting to get married or having babies. That's terrifying because I feel like I still haven't even started my life yet. I feel like I'm running out of time to get it together.

I just don't know where to start.

Sorry that was a lot of rambling. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to start turning my life around when it feels so daunting and impossible. I'm so tired of feeling stuck. 

EDIT: I forgot to say that I've also been referred to a service which helps people with mental health problems get into work. I have my first appointment with them soon.

1pn6fym,I’m 23 and do uber eats. I’m tired trying to step up in life.,"So yeah I do uber eats because I can not stand any of these fast food/ retail jobs. I can’t stand shipping places like ups and amazon anymore. But these are the only jobs I qualify for. I’m sick of it. I feel like a loser. I’m sorry if anyone works these and you enjoy it, it’s just me personally I feel like a loser working them. I have been working these kinds of jobs since I was 16 and no progress. I really want a job that takes thinking and skill. 

I was in college, and I got my associates degree, but once I was in university it was just hard, and I was failing. I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to do anymore, and overall best choice was to stop. Stop because i was taking out loans, and why am I gonna take out loans when I’m poor and not passionate. I want to go back to college later once I figured out a degree I like, and when I have stable income. I have an associates but seems like it’s basically useless. I’m currently trying to study to do medical coding, but I hear a lot that it’s hard to get a job in that too. 

I just feel hopeless. I spent like 4 years getting the associates degree and it didn’t help me step up in life at all. Now I’m doing medical coding school, and not sure if it’s possible I’ll get a job since the cert will have a label that I’m an absolute noob. Most job listings require years of experience. I don’t have connections. 

I live with my mom, thank god, or else I’d be on the streets. I’m so thankful for her, but everyday I feel horrible that she pays for my rent. I feel like a loser of a child. Everyday I do uber I don’t make a lot. It’s usually all gone quick for food, gas, and internet bill. 

I do uber bc at least I can be in my car and not deal with managers up my ass, don’t have to deal with inconsistent schedules, ect. Any other jobs i qualify for pays the same. But I’m really struggling out here and I get depressed all the time. I just wanna be able to make enough to pay my own rent and bills. I’m tired. I’m trying to research other careers fields I can get into, but it seems like most things you get into because of connections.

I guess I’m in here asking for advice. Like if you were once me what did you do to get out of this? I’d love to hear your stories. I’m trying to just keep moving forward, but man it’s hard sometimes. It’s hard not to bed rot honestly. I’m also alone, single, no friends. I don’t have much to cope with.

1pnb9xb,Need to find peace,"Hello, I’m a 20-year-old male.

I’ve been in five relationships, starting when I was 15. I have social depression, where I need attention to stimulate myself; otherwise, I mope around and feel sad because the weight of depression feels so heavy.

I made many “friends” over the years, but they always faded away. I felt forgotten the second I stopped starting conversations, and no one texted me for years. I moved from friend group to friend group, both online and in real life. I didn’t have a phone and moved a lot—I went to 10 different schools in my life.

Back to the story: friend group after friend group. At this point, I finally got a phone and was in middle school with two IRL friends and no social media because I believed I’d be kidnapped or something. After that year, I went to online school for freshman year. I had no more IRL friends, and I didn’t save their contact info because I guess I was dumb, lol.

I got Discord and dated a girl. For the first time, I could focus on one person every day—look forward to their attention, talk all day, just be with them. When she lost feelings and decided to be “just friends,” we slowly faded away. I met another girl, and the same thing happened.

Then I met another girl, but this time she was a little toxic, so there wasn’t a fade—it was an instant breakup. I was warned she was toxic, though. My problem is that I always want to be in a relationship.

A month later, I was with a new girl. We spent three years together. She broke up with me and honestly broke me throughout that relationship, but I didn’t want to be alone. I didn’t love her like I thought—I just didn’t want to be single. I needed her to be happy. She was all I had. We texted every day for three years; I couldn’t not text her. Then she fell in love with someone else and left.

After that, I went on dating apps and met another girl. I told her everything. I told her I wasn’t ready to date and that I was healing. I started falling in love with her, but before I was ready to fully commit, she accused me of cheating because I played video games with a female friend. I responded with, “We’re dating,” even though I still wasn’t ready. She said yes, and instead of saying I wasn’t ready, I decided she was the key to my happiness.

I stopped texting my friend and started dating this new girl instead of getting to know her properly. Bad decision. She was very toxic and manipulative and only saw the relationship as good if she was getting what she wanted. Instead of communicating like I asked, she blamed me for being incompetent and said I should know how to be in a relationship because I was 19 (I’m 20 now). We eventually broke up.

Then my three-year ex came back under a new name. I figured it out quickly because her mannerisms were the same. She said she was sorry, that she loved me, and would do anything to prove it. I didn’t believe her, but I didn’t want to be alone. I said we could be friends and that I forgave her—because honestly, I did—but not enough to trust her with my heart.

She was very intense, and eventually I gave in and said yes, even though I didn’t love or trust her yet. That led to her crying and saying I was hurting her the same way she had hurt me over the years. I tried to be better, but soon after, she got tired of me and found someone else again. That completely broke my trust.

We’ve been split for four days, and she’s already saying she’s going to marry this new guy because he’s IRL this time. Honestly, I wish her luck.

As for me, I want to be in a relationship, but I can’t commit to everyone the second they say they love me anymore. I need to make friends and find a beautiful woman with genuine character. I don’t know where to look, honestly, but I know I have to stay single for now. I need to find happiness and peace in life—not in other people.",2,11,2025-12-15 21:40:43,A_GUYGUY35,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pnb9xb/need_to_find_peace/,selfimprovement,1.0,Vent,0.9988,0.14178710575139145,-0.6573124527931213,1,-0.0006588052462823679,0

1pmp8w8,"I want to work but I'm scared, any help?","I’m 21 (M), and I want to work a part-time job so I can earn my own money instead of relying on my mother. But I feel really scared just thinking about it.

I dropped out of college because of social anxiety and low self-esteem. Since then, I’ve been stuck at home for about three years. I basically haven’t done much with my life—I mostly play games, fall into bad habits like watching adult content, staying up late, and doing nothing productive. I feel like I’m useless in my own house.

For the past few months, I’ve been trying to improve myself, but I don’t see any real progress in my life. My mother is struggling, and meanwhile I’ve just been staying at home doing nothing. Because of that, I decided I want to go out and find a part-time job—to help ease the situation at home and stop relying on my mom. But I’m scared. I basically freeze just thinking about it.

I feel nervous and anxious, and I don’t really know why. Maybe I’m afraid of failing at my tasks, of what people will think of me, or of stuttering when I talk to customers. I also experience a lot of brain fog. Sometimes I feel stupid—I often need to hear things twice before I can understand them. I also have ADHD.

Because of this, I’ve wasted opportunities that I could have easily taken. For example, a 7-Eleven near our area was hiring part-timers, but because of these feelings, I let that opportunity pass.

1pn5rak,"Ever feel like your brain's stuck on repeat? Same day, different date.","I've been there. Few years ago I was deep in the self-help rabbit hole—books, YouTube videos, courses that promised everything and delivered... not much. I'd get inspired for a few days, then slide back into old patterns. You know how it goes.

One night after another ""what am I doing with my life"" spiral, I just... stopped looking for the perfect solution. Started experimenting instead. Tried a bunch of small stuff over 30 days—micro-habits, some neuroplasticity ideas I'd read about, energy management tweaks. Not everything worked, but enough did that I kept going.

The habit loop thing

So there's this concept about how habits work: cue, routine, reward. Apparently something like 40% of what we do daily is basically autopilot. Once I understood that, I started messing with my cues—made them more obvious, kept the routines stupidly small (like one push-up small), and actually acknowledged the wins. Sounds basic but it helped.

Your brain isn't fixed

The neuroplasticity stuff was kind of surprising to me. Your brain keeps changing based on what you repeatedly do—it's not locked in after childhood like I'd assumed. There's that study about London cab drivers developing larger memory regions from memorizing streets. I'm not saying I became a genius, but starting with small things like morning gratitude actually shifted my default thinking over a few weeks. Felt different. Hard to explain exactly.

Why 30 days

The ""21 days to form a habit"" thing is apparently a myth—research suggests it's more like 66 days on average. But 30 days hits a sweet spot: long enough to see real changes, short enough that you don't bail halfway through. At least that's been my experience. There's something about a deadline that keeps you honest.

Small actions, weird payoffs

The 1% improvement idea from Atomic Habits sounds almost too simple, but compounding is real. 10 push-ups became a real workout over time. 100 words a day became an actual outline. I'm not saying it's magic—it's just that small consistent things add up faster than you'd expect.

The point

I'm not trying to sell some life-changing transformation here. Results vary, obviously. But if you're feeling stuck, maybe the issue isn't that you haven't found the right system—maybe it's just about trying small things and seeing what sticks for you specifically.

I put together what worked for me in a 30-day format. It's in my bio if you're curious. And if you've got a habit that's been kicking your ass, or something you tried that completely backfired—honestly I'd like to hear about it.

1pn1nfa,How to Improve major self esteem issues on appearance,"So I have always had self esteem issues about my appearance. I did therapy and I thought I was over it. However, recently, some girl told me she thought I was unattractive. I confronted her about it and she said she meant like a 6 or 7, but I felt like she was just saying that after being confronted. A lot of people do tell me I’m attractive or “handsome” but when I mentioned this to her she made it seem like that was impossible. Now, I feel like all the self esteem I built up was fully destroyed. My self esteem has gotten so bad that every time someone even looks at me now I get anxiety from it.

I realize that one persons opinion is just one persons opinion, and that attractiveness is subjective. I also realize I am putting too much emphasis on appearances. But I still can’t do anything about this feeling. Nothing I’ve learned is doing anything. It feels like her saying that confirms my fears about my appearance.

I need help and tips for how I can improve my self esteem and get over these issues, as it feels like it’s starting to take over my life.

Edit:

I do go to the gym, I try to dress nice,

I keep good care of my hygiene, and I have a skin care routine. I do lots of these things and I still have awful self esteem

1pn0666,Manifest 🦋,"First time making a post here.

Self improvement comes from self actualisation and self respect. We often absorb so much just to keep the status quo - to not disturb the balance of a situation  or a relationship.

We absorb the cruelty, the lack of presence , neglect and the lack of care because we wanna be understanding or outta love or outta care. Problem is we don’t even realise the disrespect, the absolute annihilation of our own self esteem at the hands of others who feel it’s their entitlement to throw breadcrumbs at us expecting us to be grateful for them.

Walking away and recognising our own worth is something very very hard. Be it from our family or friends or loved ones. However, it is absolutely vital if one has to grow and evolve.

Break the pattern. Realise the depth of what’s actually happening. Do not settle for bare minimum because you deserve absolute safety, security, stability and genuine care. Do not allow someone’s life situation or mental illness to become their license to abuse and manipulate you. Do not fall for threats, blackmail, hoovering (I miss u or I care AFTER the abuse) or mind games because they know they don’t have any power on u anymore. Do not allow anyone to hurt you. 

Often such manipulators wanna deflect and share the blame because it’s hard for them to acknowledge their abuse. Watch out for dismissive statements like sorry “it happened” - nope . It didn’t “happen”- they “chose” to do it.  So where is that mature , solid, honest apology? Watch out because it’s just a tactic.

Complete closure of access is often the first step to heal. No response. No acknowledgement. Complete mental and emotional block. No more access. It was a privilege they no longer deserve. 

And most of all- cherish the support. Those friends or loved ones who stand by you through the turmoil. Those are your people. Those are the ones u need to invest your time and energy and effort in.


We don’t owe anyone their peace. They are responsible for it as much as we are for ours. Surround yourself with loving and genuinely caring people. And manifest .

My mantra is

“I am safe. I am complete. I am a universe. I will love myself like no one else can. I am the truth.”

1pn80hv,How to learn to type fast once and for all,"Hi everyone! I am related to a touch typing platform, so I notice the same typing mistakes all the time. I wonder how many of these sound familiar to you. Let’s get started!

1. Typing with two fingers  
2. Placing your hands anywhere except the home row, ASDF and JKL;
3. Resting your body weight on your wrists while typing  
4. Trying to type as fast as possible without caring about accuracy  
5. Moving your fingers too much  
6. Not using your pinky fingers at all.  
7. Not practising regularly because you think touch typing isn’t important to learn.

**The most important rule** for increasing speed and reducing mistakes:

Don’t look at the keyboard. Really. Put your fingers on the home row and keep typing. It can feel frustrating at first, but if you stick with it, it becomes faster, easier, and much less tiring. Short, regular practice sessions work better than long ones, and don’t forget to take breaks when your focus drops.

Touch typing is a really useful skill to learn. The main thing is to avoid the mistakes above.

1pmiwhs,Stop reading news!,"A lot of things happen in the world every day. It will never change. Almost all news are about negative things. Horrible things even. If you want to read positive news you almost have to search for them. 
But reading negative news does not help you in any way, even worse, it can lead to Depression, completly shifted world views and destroys every good feeling you have. Dont believe me? Here is a thought experiment:

Imagine you are at a birthday party with all your relatives and friends. You laugh, you have a good time. And one of them goes to the phone and reads the news. And then he yells: ""OMG, a massive shooting happened, multiple people are dead"". You get it. The party is over at this point. Negative news will destroy all good.

Frist dont get me wrong, its not that yall shouldnt care. In fact we all care. But you simply cant do anything about it. You cant revert time and prevent it from happening. Accept it.

But if you cant do anything about it? Why feeding your inner self with such things every day? Whats the end goal? Whats the point? To destroy yourself because it would be unfair that you have joy while other have to go through horrible things? To know whats going on in the world and the prize you pay is your inner well beeing, just for that reason?

Also block all social media news sites. Social media tends to push it on your feed as ""recommended content"". Now imagine this. Imagine your neighbor comes to your house every day just to tell you all the horrible things going on right now. Then leaves. Next day again. And again and again. Would you allow that? Or would you do everything to prevent it from happening again and stop this madness? If yes, why do you allow it online? 

The point is, I would recommend to stop reading news entierly. Especially now in AI century. But if you really cant stop. Learn to use news correctly. News should not be shoved into your face without you even asking for it. Block everything so it does not get recommended again. Take a time, like 15 min. In those 15 min YOU check the latest news. After your given timeframe stop. Take control over the things you feed your inner self with. You cant control the world, but you can control what you feed yourself with. In general ask yourself what positive change does this behaviour do to me? If there is none, its bad for you. Quit.

I and some friends started doing this 3 months ago. EVERYONE agreed their mood changed, they have more energy, they feel positive overall and even better, the desire to even read some news vanished for all of us. Try it out!

1pn206y,I have no true outlets for discussing how other people and situations are affecting me outside of what’s considered gossip. How do I stop talking about things I shouldn’t be talking about?,"I want to be a person who can keep secrets and confidentiality, provided it’s moral and ethical to do so. But I also have no true outlet to discuss how things I see, hear, and experience impact me outside of what people call gossip. I have a therapist who I see weekly. That means I have to bottle everything up until then, unless I gossip. But obviously, this can impact everything from jobs to friendships to relationships.

I’ve already tried keeping myself in check by asking if what I’m hearing/seeing/experiencing actually affects me. But given my stress levels by not getting it off my chest, the answer is a resounding yes. I’ve tried staying away from people and situations who give me things I need to talk about, but I can no longer do that without having a job or friends. Which I will of course lose if this continues.

It’s also very difficult when most people gossip, and they include me in it. I’m not confrontational and already have so few friends; I don’t want to make them feel bad by asking them to not tell me things. I’ve been told this is holier-than-thou when I’ve tried. But I seem to gossip more and I get in social trouble for it more. Others seem to have it figured out, and I do not, so I should stop.

Diaries don’t work. There’s no social feedback. AI doesn’t work because it stores all the data al will spew it out to whoever it talks to about something similar next. It also doesn’t allow me to vocalize my thoughts and hear an audio response back, which is how I connect.

How the hell do I stop?

EDIT: for context, I’m autistic. For me, that manifests in being unable to communicate in questions on the spot, I can really only do statement responses or anecdote responses because I can’t process speech quickly enough to engage with questions.

 \-I have a really bad phone addiction(I spend my entire day on the phone)

\-HUGE (and I mean HUGE) self esteem issues,insecurity,fear of abandoment.And as you can guess,since my breakup it has gotten to shit(I’m a bit suicidal too,but I’m too much of a coward to actually do it)

There’s other issues,but that’s all I can remember now.

I do therapy,I tried many times to start a diet,hit the gym,and do other stuff,but I’m such a lazy,unmotivated and depressed piece of shit that everytime I just go back to my addictions and give up.

1pm8vn7,Why the people who love you most can kill your biggest goals?,"for an entire year, Sara Blakely didn't tell her friends or family her dreams. Not because she was worried they'd steal the idea. Because she knew they'd kill it.

""Out of love and concern, people will tell you things that stop the idea dead in its tracks,"" Blakely said. ""I didn't want to invite ego into the process too soon. I wanted to spend time pursuing it, not defending it.""

She figured this out instinctively. Peter Gollwitzer at NYU ran experiments in 2009. 163 people wrote down goals, becoming a lawyer, starting a business, whatever. Half announced it to the room. Half kept quiet. Everyone got 45 minutes to work on it.

Silent people worked the full 45 minutes. They felt like they had a long way to go. People who announced it? Quit after 33 minutes. Said they felt way closer to their goal even though they'd barely started.

Your brain treats social recognition as partial completion. Someone congratulates you on your plan, you get a little hit of satisfaction. Gollwitzer called it ""social reality"" - enough people act like you've accomplished something, your mind believes it's partially done.

Blakely waited a full year. By the time she told her family about Spanx, she'd researched fabrics, filed patents, and found manufacturers. She'd invested enough that she wasn't turning back.

They said exactly what would have stopped her earlier: ""If it's such a good idea, why hasn't someone done it already?"" ""The big guys will knock you off in six months.""

Too late. She was already committed.

""If I'd heard that the night I cut the feet out of my pantyhose, I'd probably still be selling fax machines.""

Loss aversion makes this worse. Kahneman and Tversky spent decades proving that people feel losses about twice as hard as equivalent gains. Your family sees your $5,000 in savings as a potential disaster. They can't see the billion-dollar upside because the loss is screaming twice as loud. They imagine you failing. They ask, ""what if it doesn't work?"" They remind you about bills. The loss looms larger than any gain.

Derek Sivers has a short TED talk on this. He says, ""Do you feel the excitement when you want to tell someone about your goal?"" That's fuel. Burn it on conversation, and you have less for the actual work.

Does this mean never tell anyone? No. There are times when sharing help. You need emotional support, you need specific expertise, you need accountability because you have a track record of following through on public commitments.

Blakely had a rule: tell people who can move it forward. Patent lawyers, manufacturers, and people with specific skills. Don't tell people who just have opinions.

If announcing your goal makes you feel accomplished, that's the premature satisfaction Gollwitzer measured. Bad sign. If it makes you anxious about pulling it off, that might create useful pressure. But only if you typically finish what you start.

If you're at the beginning with nothing tangible, and the people you're telling see mainly risk? Their advice will discourage you even when they mean well. If you already have momentum and something concrete, their support might actually help.

Blakely built Spanx to $1.2 billion without outside investors. She says keeping it secret early on is one of the main reasons it exists. Her family wasn't wrong, she could have lost everything, big companies could have copied her, and the odds were against her.

They were wrong about which outcome mattered more.

**Whose fear are you managing, yours or theirs?**

P.S. This was researched and written with AI assistance - I verified Gollwitzer's 2009 study across multiple databases, cross-checked Blakely's quotes from CNBC, Fortune, SUCCESS Magazine, Inc, and How I Built This podcast, confirmed Kahneman & Tversky's loss aversion research from their original 1979 and 1991 papers, and fact-checked every mechanism and claim.

1pmiqk7,"I am affection deprived. I have too many friends, and don't want to date. Am I dismissing the only two options I have?","In brief, I am experiencing negative physical and mental effects from affection deprivation, and have been for a few years now.
I have plenty supportive and loving friends, and I am overall happy with myself and my life. I also go to therapy every other week, but the only thing I'm ever really talking to her about is this.

Thing is, while I'm surrounded by love, I am starved of affection. The two friends I live with do not reciprocate my affection anymore, and have not since May 2023. When they are affectionate, it's sparse and with one another. (I asked one of them why the situation changed a year or so ago, and they don't know. This is likely true.) And that's not to say they refuse to be affectionate. If I ask for a hug, I get a hug. But having to ask for it is far from having it.

Not experiencing that affection anymore has been very hard on my body and mind. I have tried many solutions, but I don't think this will go away until I address the root issue. I have asked for affection to resume, but that was unsuccessful. I have considered getting more friends, but I already have too many as it is, and can barely make time for them all. I've also looked into getting a romantic partner, but that feels inconsiderate. (I worry it would be rude of me to start dating just because I am not getting affection from my friends. Am I right to think that? Genuinely asking.) I also just don't really want to date all that much. Not because of my bad experience last time, but rather because I don't have a ton of time in a week to do it right.

Do I have any other options beyond just bearing with it? Or must I swallow my girevences and find more friends or a partner anyway?",7,6,2025-12-14 22:21:24,Bradenoid,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pmiqk7/i_am_affection_deprived_i_have_too_many_friends/,selfimprovement,0.82,Question,0.9767,0.13268562245834975,-0.4567975699901581,0,0.0911483394965909,0

How do you keep motivation?,"I was able to come post on here through the universe's grace. I survived lets a permanent solution attempt. I promised my distraught parents I will get better so here goes.

I’m in a rebuild phase. I left a toxic healthcare job that was damaging my mental health, have been back home for a few months, and recently picked up a part-time role while I work toward something full-time. Finding a job is really tough for me right now. Living back at home.

I’m 29M, a virgin, and I do want sex and intimacy, I’ve just never had much “game,” and dating apps haven’t worked for me. Between school, work stress, and now rebuilding, dating never really took off.

**What I** ***am*** **doing is actively trying to change my trajectory:** I’m in therapy, training consistently at the gym, cleaning up my diet, applying for roles, and now even working with a career coach. Progress is slow and not visible yet, which makes it mentally tough.

1pmm151,My hypothesis on living our most thriving life,"In this world, hard work is almost always required to achieve results. This is true in virtually, if not, every area of life. Many people try to optimize their happiness through the path of least resistance, which is human nature. However, the best way to feel our happiest is to put in the hard work and go against the grain of our natural tendencies.

Specifically, what I'm referring to is exercise and healthy eating (though this translates to other areas as well). Many people will try to get easy solutions such as supplements and oftentimes medications. Caveat is, this does NOT mean that if you have issues such as depression, anxiety, etc. that you should workout in lieu of these things. Rather, putting in the hard work should be the foundation of our life, and things such as medications and supplements should be the support needed to achieve these things, if necessary. 

In other words, medications and supplements may be required for a lot of people. But this doesn't give you a free pass to neglect a healthy lifestyle. The hard work is required of all of us. Some people may need meds to even get started on living a healthy life. Some people may not get sufficient nutrients in their diet (in some cases including healthy diets that may lack certain nutrients). With that in mind, those should ultimately be the support to getting the end goal in mind, which is to live a healthy lifestyle that nourishes our bodies instead of working against it.

This has been said a million times before in a million different ways, so I don't consider this to be some profound breakthrough. However, the reason I mention all this is to highlight the requirements of us to still put in the hard work, regardless of other setbacks that may be in place (such as neurochemical imbalances that require medical treatment). 

  
There are other ways that you might be able to take this and apply it to other areas. Resisting the urge to doomscroll instead of taking time for yourself to do things that are better for you. Actively being social and seeking out a supportive community that makes you feel like you belong is another (loosely related). Many of these things don't always come naturally. But we as humans evolved in the face of struggle and persistence, and those two things will remain a quintessential part of our experience until humanity's end. There is no pill you can take that can erase the requirements of all of us, even if it is part of your path to success.",3,5,2025-12-15 00:33:58,yeeahitsethan,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pmm151/my_hypothesis_on_living_our_most_thriving_life/,selfimprovement,0.81,Fitness,0.9912,0.1519615800865801,0.0,1,0.32775231601731597,1
1pmnrya,"Big choice of life decision, a few year I’m thinking about it but still feels stuck and unsure of the right choice. About what location to live and be happy with it","Hello (30 m here), a few year ago I’ve started to think about where I want to live and for exemple buy a house , I said to myself i will live roommate and I will live somewhere and try to save money for latter until I know better. 
Now I want to move after 3 years and find my place in apartment or in a house. The hard part is to be 100% sure I search to the right place/ city.


It’s one of the hardest choice to make in my life because I fear that even if I know there not a good or bad choice, I feel if I take the wrong one I will miss the best life I could have if that make sense ( sorry English is not my main language ) 

I’m from eastern Canada and I’ve already lived in western Canada for a few month I liked there a lot , and I’m a little bit of an explorer , I like to discover new place and stuff, so maybe that why I fear of being stuck somewhere if I choose a city/ region to live. 

The world is so big with so many choice we can make and I’m sure lots of good place to be/ with different culture and mentality. 

I know that in life we got to try something if we don’t do anything it’s still a choice , so it’s a big dilemma for me and I don’t know where to start. Also love to be anywhere but maybe would be sad to be away from family too long if I never come back more than once a year.

I wanted this thing so fucking bad. I planned A YEAR BEFORE and i daydreamed about this like it was the purpose of my whole life. I felt like i knew i was gonna win, failure wasn't an option to me.

No one.

And now im depressed and people just tell me to stop caring about it and they say i can try again next year but what the fuck am i supposed to do in the meanwhile?

I just wanna life a normal life enjoying things normal people do, i dont want to be this ambitious anymore especially because i failed and now i don't have a purpose in my life anymore.

1pljogq,Being 'nice' is kinda selfish,"Controversial take: The ""nice guy"" is not a good person.

A 1979 study found that people who scored high on ""social desirability"" (the ones who need everyone to like them) *described* themselves as assertive and confident. But when measured behaviorally, they were actually less assertive and more anxious.

Their self-perception was a performance. Their niceness was a mask for fear.

Why ""nice"" is actually selfish:

Research on something called ""Unmitigated Communion"" shows that the ""helping"" done by people-pleasers is ""motivated more by egoistic rather than altruistic concerns."" The real motive is not help for the sake of helping but rather to enhance one's own esteem in the eyes of others.""

Psychologist Robert Glover (in his book No More Mr. Nice Guy btw great book) calls these ""Covert Contracts"" which toxic, unspoken if-then deals:

* ""If I'm nice to you, you'll be attracted to me""
* ""If I anticipate your needs, you'll anticipate mine""
* ""If I avoid conflict, my life will be problem-free""

But the other person doesn't know the contract exists. So when they don't reciprocate (because they're not mind readers), the ""nice"" person feels cheated and becomes resentful.

The ""niceness"" was never a gift. It was a down payment on an expected return.

What makes this worse is that this pattern often originates from childhood trauma. It's called the ""Fawn"" response which is a survival mechanism where safety is achieved by appeasing a perceived threat. The child learns their survival depends on suppressing their own needs.

So this isn't a habit but a nervous system response.

The actual definition difference:

* ""Nice"" = pleasing, agreeable, delightful (focused on EFFECT on others)
* ""Kind"" = having, showing, or proceeding from benevolence (focused on MOTIVATION)

Kindness has ethical significance. Niceness doesn't.

What real kindness looks like:

* Telling someone the truth even when it's uncomfortable
* Setting boundaries because you matter too
* Saying no without apologizing
* Giving without expectation
* Being willing to be disliked for being authentic

Sometimes the kindest thing isn't ""nice"" at all.",533,87,2025-12-13 17:24:16,External_Tumbleweed1,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pljogq/being_nice_is_kinda_selfish/,selfimprovement,0.88,Other,0.9904,0.21100308641975307,-0.5799633860588074,-1,0.049338924254546945,0
1pmujsy,How to deepen my voice like a man as a woman?,"(28F) Long intro because I need to rant a bit. If you don’t feel like reading, you can skip to the last paragraph.

I’ve wanted a deeper voice for as long as I can remember. I’ve been trying to train my voice since pre high school, and even now, I’m still not very happy with how my voice sounds(still sounds like a woman)

That said, I don’t want to be transgender. I’m asexual, I’ve lived my whole life without any partners and I’m just not interested in that. But I do feel jealous every time I hear a deep male voice. On top of that, there was a friend I knew in university. She’s a woman, but her voice is insanely cool. If you didn’t see her face, you’d genuinely think she was a man. Her voice is deep and very masculine, and I had to tell her how much I loved her voice. She told me she’s always been like this and that she actually likes it about herself. I was so jealous.

She didn’t seem uncomfortable with it at all. She’s also a very big woman physically, so maybe that contributes to her deep voice? I’m not sure...
.
.
.

I don’t know if I’m too old for this now, because I’m already this age. So I want to ask everyone: is there a way for women to make their voice deeper? How long does it usually take? If possible, I’d really love to hear from women who have deep voices. I genuinely want to hear your voices 🙏

1pmfjtx,Shaping your character and building confidence through expierence.,"Hey,

as a child I was extremely shy and always hiding behind my parents. Throughout my teens and 20s, I did a lot of stuff which really helped me find my personality. I sought these challenges to learn something new about myself.

Each challenge I finished helped me shape my character and discover my true self.

**Stuff I did:**

* Finished M.Sc. in engineering
* Competing at a national level (acrobatics), I could do at one point a double backflip
* Having the same girlfriend since 10+ years
* Traveling half the planet (example: I visited 25 states in USA)
* Fitness challenges like 100 muscle ups, 100 backflips, hyrox etc. 
* Won a national science prize
* I founded a startup and had it for 2 years
* Competed at a Red Bull fun event
* Was featured in a bigger podcast
* Work and travel for 6 months
* I was on TV a few times
* I was an XMA kids instructor
* I was 2 years in a stunt school

And many many more. I have countless more stories which some are positive and some negative but in the end every one shaped me. It's nothing too crazy but in summary, everything I did shaped me in a certain way.

**Learning examples:**

**Work and travel:**

* I learned that I can live on my own and I can be funny sometimes
* I hate ONS, after a few I realized that they suck and I look for something long-term (which I did)
* Don't take life too seriously

**Startup:**

* I realized that I am not the best engineer
* But I also realized I am great at managing people and projects. Therefore I work as a project engineer.

**Sports:**

* I can push really hard
* I know nearly all my strength and weaknesses. I suck at running but Iam good at pressing, Iam explosive but overall pretty weak etc. etc. 

**There is often no glory in it but looking back makes you proud!**

**100 muscle ups:** after 50 reps my hands ripped and I couldn't false grip anymore. After 70 reps I needed to run to the bin each time because I felt like throwing up. My whole body was messed up for 2 weeks...

**Startup:** I put my life into it. I worked 12 hours 7 days a week and put everything I had into it. I sneaked out of bed at night just to work on projects. In the end we got betrayed by one guy and he destroyed everything... It took me months to recover from it! But I am glad I did it.

**Traveling:** I had no money while I was in university, so I worked after uni for 9 months to save for one USA trip. Uni + work was a 70-80h week, just blew it all in 3 weeks. I didnt party, I didnt bought myself anything. I was just learning and working. My gf got sundays with for 6h. I was burned out after that and wouldn't do it ever again...

**You don't need to ask yourself WHAT IF!?**

You did it, you know what you have accomplished or not! There's no shame in failing, only in not trying! Most of my friends could easily do what I did but they didn't. They always explain to me what would they do in my position but I dont care because in this case **""talk is cheap""**

**Today:** I am 33 and I feel pretty confident in myself because of my experiences that shaped me. I know my strengths but also know my weaknesses. I don't ask myself what if but rather what can I improve in my life. I still learn a lot of stuff. I still do challenges like a 15 min ice bath in a frozen lake (that was plain stupid, lesson learned lol) or going to an MMA class (just to get beat up by everybody haha) but after such experiences suddenly the presentation for the CEO doesn't feel so scary anymore!

 If you are still stuck deciding, know that action will give you the most amount of clarity. Have you ever heard of someone who thought their way to their goals? Who started absolutely perfectly?

1pmktpv,"I must quit five things on December 18, 2025. I'm ready!","On December 18, 2025, the 5 substances I must quit are weed, cigarettes, beer, caffeine and porn. 

I should've quit all of these things a long time ago. 

Alcohol I should've quit on December 3, 2021, and kept my streak going beyond 168 days. Weed I should've quit on January 4, 2017, Cigarettes should've been November 25, 2018, Caffeine should've been March 4, 2022, when I began a weed tolerance break that lasted 58 days. Porn I should've quit when I was 18 years old, so December 18, 2013 but 12 years late is certainly better than 24 years late isn't that right? 

So, I remember putting a dollar per day into a savings account in early 2024 when I quit weed, but I still smoked tobacco through the bong and drank way too much alcohol and caffeine, not to mention still watched porn/masturbated. 

All 5 must go, the reason is, when the day come someone tries to slander me online, especially a famous person and the can do this with their 1A rights. 

If the majority of people agree with the mocking and ridiculing comments, than encourage scorn and derision, even if the majority or all for that matter agree, but there objectively wrong, their opinions become irrelevant, because right now my whole adult life beyond 24 was terrible for employment. 

Goals to achieve (by giving up these 5 while I'm still alive). 

- Get A Job (Dishwashing) 
- Get My License Again 
- Get A Girlfriend (Good Luck, LMAO!)  
- Get A Friend who doesn't possess a dick but also isn't a dick (Now were talking!) 
- Get Friends who don't use substances (especially on a regular basis) 
- Get my savings account with $5 for everyday sober (so after 145 oddly superior days, I'd have $725!) 

So right now, I'm not using any of the 5 but when I do have each last it's around 7:30 a.m. Thursday. 

I smoke weed (with a cigarette), watch one last porn with a crank, then I drink a beer and energy drink and then it's of course would be a rough week until Christmas, better by New Years and once we get into 2026, the days will get so much easier. 

The withdrawals from weed were fairly rough this morning, but I'm in a better mood knowing I'm paid and mom will help me with groceries. 

I know many will think it's ridiculous for my soon to be 62f mom to be buying my soon to be 31m groceries often, but I get the essential items.  

Things like eggs, bread, cheese, onions, potatoes, rice and beans. Or sometimes ramen noodles, Gatorade on sale, microwavable spaghettis or 40% off chicken. 

If I quit these substances with internet porn, I'll ne doing a lot better for myself, and the truth won't hurt because the bullshit won't be relevant. 

Some Right-Wing A-hole online: ""Lol, I'm getting mad loser vibes from this dude and ridicule my Facebook profile in the same manner as some people will do my post history for things like that and I'm pretty sure there's a bit of a disturbing one that was also political, and it also mentioned a song that was stuck in my head where the lead singer did something absolutely horrible and I felt bad for the other band members who had to learn about what the lead singer had done. 

I don't know if anyone's heard about it, but the singer's name is Ian Watkins (July 30, 1977) and he was serving a 29-year sentence in prison but then was fatally attacked on October 11th 2025 earlier this year. 

I often will listen to the ATV Offroad Fury 2 soundtrack from nostalgic purposes but it's so hard to listen to that song I used to Love and enjoy so much because now I know what that lead singer did. 

I also apologize if I just went off topic, but it really bothered me lately because I know if I was listening to it people would absolutely think I'm a terrible person but I absolutely despise Ian just like everyone else, in every way possible. 

The song that stuck in my head is a song called Shinobi and Dragon Ninja by Lostprophets. I shouldn't have to feel terrible for listening to it because I absolutely have horrible emotional feelings towards Ian's unforgivable crimes.

1plz4v1,"person I was seeing ended things, it’s got me thinking maybe I’m boring/shallow…","I’m not really sure how to tag this. I (26F) was seeing someone (32M) for a few months, and he ended things recently. I had been pretty happy with how things were going, so it kind of blindsided me. Essentially, his reasoning was that he doesn’t feel that deeper connection, there’s silence at times when we are together (which never bothered me, I don’t know that I need to be constantly engrossed in conversation), and he doesn’t feel that excitement about me that he wants to feel. Valid reasons, and I was bummed but I’ll live.

Now though, I’m starting to worry it may be me that’s the problem. I’m worried that, maybe I am boring or too surface level to have a meaningful relationship. I will say, I have great social skills and am good with people, I have a strong network of friends, etc. But most of my life consists of going to work every day, going to the gym a few times a week, getting home cooking dinner cleaning up and taking care of my pet, then doing it all again. I see my friends a couple times a week, and then after all that, I feel like there’s not much time for other things. I’ve been struggling financially for about the past year, so I can’t really afford to take cool trips or go fun places.. I’m not some cool backcountry skier, I’m not in a band, I don’t have exciting hobbies to talk about constantly.

Maybe he found me unexciting because I am, in fact, unexciting. Does anyone have advice? Am I too surface level for someone to connect with deeply?

1pmj3b2,What’s helped me that can help you,"I’m bored so I decided to write some things down that have been helping me that could potentially help other people. 

Journaling. I know journaling is kind of lame but believe me it works. Nobody would describe me as the journaling type, hell I’m surprised I’ve kept up with it for so long but it’s such a good emotional outlet. It’s also enlightening to look at yourself in different mental states. It can help you realize how unreasonably biased towards the negative you get sometimes. It’s also evidence, if you’re curious about what triggers depressive episodes or what makes you happy for the day, a journal is a great reference to draw conclusions upon.

Envisioning the ideal. So what’s probably helped me the most this month in particular is envisioning an idealized version of me. This version of me is only called by my last name. For anonymity let’s call him smith. Smith isn’t me, smith is a semi realistic semi unrealistic version of me. I wrote down in my journal some traits that smith has and try to embody some of them everyday. 

If I had to focus on the most impactful trait of smith it’s his ability to stop Catastrophizing. Catastrophizing is generally making a big deal out of something small. I’m sure everybody with any sort of depression struggles with this. It’s the “nobody likes me” or “I’m a burden to everyone” sort of comments. These lack nuance and are biased towards the negative. Anytime I find myself looking for memories to reinforce these negative quotes I ask myself a couple of questions. “Is there something to be learned from this memory that I don’t already know?” Usually the answer is No, cause I’ve thought about the cringe and bad memories about a billion times. I’ve analyzed why I did it, what my intentions were, what my state of mind was, how it impacted a relationship, how my actions relate to my childhood trauma etc. the point being is I’ve thought about it from every angle so ultimately, there’s nothing new to be gained except for feeling sad. Why does it make me feel sad? Cause it’s a sad memory lol. Your suffering has to have purpose, if you’re looking towards sad events in your life with nothing to learn then there’s no purpose to your suffering. Suffering purposefully is the key to living a fulfilling life.

1pm9ewx,Any advice for redeveloping self-discipline and keeping yourself accountable?,"Hey everyone,

  
I'm kind of disappointed with the way some things have been going. I've definitely had some roadblocks in my life recently that have put me off track. I'm going to therapy and slowly improving. I just feel like I am reaching that point where it's very important to start redeveloping the self-discipline I lost. When I hit those hard times, I became empty and had difficulty seeing any real point to bettering myself. I didn't have any kind of end goal I felt was worth working towards. Now, that has changed. I have something to work towards.

Overall, I think I need some general practical strategies to start making some real progress. Would anyone mind reminding me of some?

\\/The things I feel may be bringing me down\\/

1. Eating. With my current living situation, I can't use a kitchen. I'm forced to prepare and eat everything in my room. I have this minifridge, electric kettle, rice cooker, microwave, toaster oven, toaster, and a blender. I recently moved the minifridge up on my dresser so there is less of a barrier to using it. I also just ordered an electric burner so I can finally start making stuff in a pan again. Due to not being able to use a kitchen and being so cramped with my mini fridge, limited supplies, and 12 hour workdays, I've been finding myself picking up fast food a lot. This wasn't a big deal at first, but it slowly developed into a dependency. I haven't been able to work out for the past month due to injuries, and I've now seen myself put on some weight.

  
2. Electronic devices. I'm not scrolling braindead through TikTok or Instagram, but I am watching multiple hours of YouTube every day. I use YouTubes/porn videos at the end of the day before bed. I don't know. I feel like if I spent some of that time reading or writing and reflecting on the day, I would make a lot more progress.

  
I think, overall, accountability is one of my biggest issues. I know some of the changes I can implement, but when it comes down to actually doing them, I rarely follow through.

1pmf6fe,I realized healing doesn’t feel like motivation — it feels like slowing down,"For a long time, I thought improving myself meant pushing harder — more discipline, more effort, more fixing. Especially when it came to anxiety and mental health, I believed that if I just tried hard enough, I’d finally feel better.

What I didn’t expect was that real improvement felt… quiet.

It felt like:
	•	needing more rest instead of more goals
	•	becoming less reactive instead of more productive
	•	saying no more often
	•	being gentler with my thoughts
	•	not chasing constant motivation

At first, I thought something was wrong. I felt tired even though I was “doing better.” But I’m starting to understand that slowing down wasn’t failure — it was my nervous system finally learning safety.

The biggest shift for me has been realizing that improvement isn’t always about becoming more.
Sometimes it’s about carrying less.

Less pressure.
Less self-criticism.
Less urgency.

I’m still figuring it out, but this mindset change alone has helped my anxiety more than forcing positivity ever did.

1pln92c,How I Stayed Motivated in a Toxic Job and Found My Purpose,"I worked as a finance professional. My profile was interesting, and I enjoyed the work, but the work ethics, team dynamics, and hierarchical interference were way too high.

Being a federal job, my family & friends pressured me to continue working there, saying workplaces are similar anyway.

As a student and employee, I’d always been diligent and usually ranked well.

But doing well at a job like this meant constant intimidation by seniors and being berated for things that were done right (opposing corruption, lol).

I even tried whistleblowing to keep myself amused but things kept getting worse. I stopped applying for promotions because it would make matters worse. Yet, I never lost motivation despite the constant pressure and fear antics.

When I reflect, I find these are 4 things that helped me stay motivated:

\* Keeping my focus on doing the job well.  
\* Never letting harsh treatment affect my behavior towards my team and clients.  
\* Being useful: Co-workers, colleagues, and clients saw me as the go-to person for technical issues, knowing I could always bail them out in tricky situations.  
\* Doing things for the benefit of others rather than just for promotions or paychecks.

Later, when things got too dirty, I resigned.

I devoted a year re-aligning my skills and spent time on meditation and yoga. My interest in yoga gradually heightened.

I volunteer with two corporate-run NGOs, helping undergraduates from underserved communities and training rural women in financial skills.  
I often talk to them about the benefits of mental hygiene and the clarity that meditation brings.

Two years later, I’m now also a trained yoga teacher and look forward to pursuing this path.

What I discovered is simple:  
\* Focus on doing things to the best of your abilities.  
\* Work for the benefit of all involved.

You tend to grow manifold compared to working just for promotions or paychecks. You discover your IKIGAI organically when your *motivation is to be useful, not misused, manipulated, or exploited.*

If you *work willingly*, with the *childlike exuberance of a volunteer*, you will experience life to its fullest and grow beyond what you ever imagined. I realized this even while volunteering at Sadhguru’s ashram in India.

I hope more people realize this early in life and touch the core of Bliss.

Not suggesting a TL;DR for this one, because I think you must read this in full ;).

1pmd5uf,Just a rant about myself and how I want to change for the better,"Not sure why I’m writing this post, but it will be my birthday in a few weeks. Well, my year has been stressful and underwhelming at the same time. I don’t think I achieved much this year. I didn’t make any real friends and didn’t really gain new skills, except for a basic understanding of how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had planned to get into drawing toward the end of the year, but I didn’t really practice much because of increased schoolwork toward the end, depression, and not having internet (I really need to stop making excuses as my New Year’s resolution).

I generally feel like I’m failing myself every year that passes closer to my time to left my house because feel like I’m not developing as a person, both in skills and behavior. It has always been my dream to create a game and artpiece  that I’m proud of, because I believe creativity is the soul expressing itself to the world. That’s why I’m obsessed with art (I literally have over 7,000 artworks of different things I like on my phone). I may have a problem.

When I see my art, I can’t help but compare it to others’. I know that’s not healthy in the slightest but I can’t help it. And it’s not just with others. I do this thing where I create something, see the flaws in it, and believe a version of me could have done much better. I tell myself I’m pathetic for not noticing the flaws sooner. I do this with everything: my homework, coding projects, art, and even my relationships.

I know I have these problems, and I’m trying my best to fix them, but it feels like it never works. Plus, I don’t feel like I can really talk to my family about this. It’s not that I have bad parents or anything like that it’s just that we’re going through a difficult period right now, and I try not to be a bother (which I don’t seem to be very good at). I kind of feel like I’m just dragging myself through life, and that I’m alone.

I feel like a failure, or a watered down version of my true self. My ADHD and spelling problems (as you can probably see in this post) don’t help with this either.

So I just want to ask this okay, here I go. I would like an art piece done of a person reaching toward a light, with angelic wings growing from their back. This is probably a stupid request, and I’m sure almost nobody will take it seriously but I want to to use it as a reminder to keep improving myself next year (since I’m very easily distracted). I also love Christian and religious imagery, even though I’m not a very good Christian and probably going to hell. I just hope next year is a good year for me and for everyone.

I also hope I didn’t come across as prideful or rude in this post; my family says I do that a lot. I want to wish everyone who read this post to the end a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. And to everyone struggling with negative mental health conditions: you are loved, and you don’t need to bottle everything up like I do.

I'm a student. whenever I work hard for something, and get good results, I'm, kinda like, blinded by the result that ""I'm doing good"" and feel no urge to work hard after that. I try to, but in the back of my mind their is this feeling that I'm already good enough, and stops from pushing myself.

1plhffo,I’m 33F and my mortality has never hit me harder than it has now.,"The title sounds so depressing but I can assure you, it’s more profound than that. 

All of my adult life it’s been about the long game. What I do today and how it impacts the future. While that’s not always bad, I now feel like it can hold you back negatively in various ways. 

I by no means live some glamorous life. I sell insurance, which I really enjoy what I do. Before that I waited tables for 12 years and for 6 of those years I also had a small house cleaning business alone. Many people in my family have always said they don’t worry about me because I’ve always been a workaholic of sorts, always been driven in that way. I knew more about finances by 20 years old than many people my age today do. I like having certain things, but I can just as easily deem something to be  too expensive. 

I’ve been divorced once, and then had a broken engagement after almost 6 years together. We split a month after I turned 30. Never in my wildest dreams did I think THAT was how I’d start this decade: going from engaged, owning a home to moving back to my moms and having to sell that house. Selling the house was heavy on me aside from the break up itself, because it’s all I’ve wanted my whole life. I don’t know when I’ll not be heartbroken over that part of it. Anyway, it’s this event that really flipped a switch in me and how I view everything around me. 

It feels like I went from having infinite time to having a ticking clock that could stop at anytime. Time both flies by so quickly and feels so drawn out. Even 10 years ago feels like 3 lifetimes ago because of how much I’ve changed, but the next 10 years feels like they will be over faster than I want them to be. I lost the first 2 years of my 30s healing from losing everything in one felt swoop. 

Suddenly money feels more replaceable. Like, what the fuck will I have to look back on if I only live in a way that makes retirement survivable? I’m less concerned about it because there are things I want to do now that I know I won’t later in life. I have things I wanted to do in my 20s that I didn’t get to do, and now that I’m in my 30s it doesn’t interest me as much - but man, I wish I had done them for the memories. I have so much I want to do and want to experience, so suddenly I feel the gravity of mortality in a way I never did before.

Ironically, I spent a great deal of my teens and 20s struggling with mental illness, which came with the intrusive end-my-life ideology. I spent a great deal of time not sure if I’d see my 30s. But I tell you what, I fought hard for this. I survived years of being ignored before my parents got me help, only after my begging. I saw multiple psychiatrists and therapists. Living with bipolar is hard, unrelenting, and challenging but it can be done. I always said it wasn’t that I wanted to be dead, it was the fact that I wanted to live so badly it hurt. I think it’s in feeling my mortality that those thoughts have left me, and not feeling like I need that mental back door - like that “option” was almost a comfort that if this became too much, I could opt out anytime. It helped me not feel so stuck in my pain. 

Now, I’ve survived what felt like the end of me. That last break up damn near destroyed me, but it is because of that experience that I feel like I can really actually live life. I can handle anything thrown at me in the name of living life. For the first time in my life I want to take up space, claim my place in this world. 


It’s in the small things. I’m not as concerned about saving money when it comes to the difference in experiences. For example, I’ve been on the hunt for a new blanket for the bed because I have a thyroid disease and I sleep hot a lot. I’ve looked into wool because it’s supposed to be great for moisture wicking and temp control. It’s looking like a $250 investment. Typically I’d laugh at that price and end up with a much cheaper blanket…but what if I could sleep so much better because of a justifiably more expensive blanket? 

I don’t like to waste money, but I’m not pinching every dime anymore. I want to travel, enjoy things in life. I don’t and won’t have any children so I have more disposable income in that way, aside from saving for a house. I was incredibly lucky and fortunate to not walk away from that break up with nothing…thank the market surge after Covid, I have been able to sit on a nest egg to eventually buy a house again. 


But even that - eventually - that used to feel like so much time. I’m finding that I need to set more concrete goals than I used to because I don’t have all the time in the world. I’m incredibly stubborn so I am determined to get a house again. I want to build a life with my boyfriend, hopefully get married in the next few years. I’ve become more decisive about what I want because time goes by too quickly now.


In the past I’d call this thought process borderline reckless, but being so calculated didn’t exactly work out for me either. I still ended up divorced by 22, having to start over twice by the time I was 30. Again, I’m still smart about finances but I refuse to just live for retirement. I feel free, like I’m just now starting to see what living is supposed to be. 


This became a much longer tangent than intended, but my heart kind of spilled over once I got going. This all started because of looking at wool blankets. All I was going to talk about was being more open to spending more on things for the sake of comfort or enjoyment. So thanks for coming to my Ted talk, and I’d love to hear if anyone else can resonate.

1plznt2,"What do you do when ""self-improvement"" starts to feel like a list of chores?","I hit a wall with self-improvement a while back. It was the usual cycle: read a book, get inspired, make a grand plan... and then watch it all fall apart when real life showed up. The planners, the habit trackers, the journals-they all ended up making me feel worse. Every unchecked box was a little proof that I wasn't ""improving"" fast enough.

I realized my mistake was thinking self-improvement had to be about adding things. More routines, more writing, more discipline. It felt like a second job I was failing at.

The shift happened when I flipped it. Instead of adding, I started subtracting pressure. My first experiment was with journaling. I loved the idea of it-getting clarity, processing the day-but I hated the act of writing. Staring at a blank page felt like homework.

So I broke the rule. I stopped ""journaling"" and started just answering one simple multiple-choice question a day. Stuff like:

""What's the dominant energy today?"" ( Energetic,  Neutral,  Drained)

""What does my focus feel like?"" ( Sharp,  Scattered, Nonexistent)

No paragraphs. No pressure to be profound. Just a click. It took less than 30 seconds, but it did something powerful: it made me pause and notice myself without judgment. That tiny moment of awareness became my anchor. It wasn't about building a perfect habit; it was about creating a single, consistent point of connection with my own state.

From there, I looked for the simplest possible tool to keep this practice frictionless. I stumbled on Habit , which is essentially that-a calm, minimal space that serves you a couple of thoughtful, multiple-choice questions. No login, no notifications, no streak counters to guilt you. It’s just a gentle prompt to check in. I'm mentioning it not to promote it, but because it perfectly embodies the ""less is more"" philosophy that finally worked for me.

I'm curious about your experience: Have you ever successfully simplified a self-improvement practice instead of adding to it? What's one thing you stopped forcing yourself to do, and what did you replace it with?

1pm2o60,Advice on how to change my mindset about improving my career,"Hi Everyone.

36M, engineer for the last 12 years at various companies. I will preface this with the fact that I do have GAD and OCD, so use that knowledge as you will to interpret my post.

Lately, I’ve noticed I’ve been reflecting/ruminating on my job performance and I’m not happy. I don’t think I’m in any danger of getting fired or PIP’d, but I compare myself to other engineers in our group who are many years younger than me and I believe their achievements and recognition demonstrate that they are objectively better than me. They’re all very friendly and pleasant to work with, but it’s clear they are more career focused than me. It makes me wish I had taken my career more seriously when I was younger and not just passively skirt by and collect a paycheck. I also keep convincing myself that I should be at a higher level in my career. Every time I think about attending online trainings or reading books to improve my technical knowledge, I can never focus and just think to myself that it’s too late and I should have done this years ago instead. I know that one is never too old to change and improve, but I just can’t shake this mindset every time I try to make the effort. Growing up, I was always in the gifted classes and used to people telling me I was so smart, but now I just feel mediocre and like a failure.

I want to get on the road to self-improvement and am open to any recommendations anyone may have to help me begin to change my outlook on my life.",2,4,2025-12-14 07:47:22,ScoopsMcGoop69,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pm2o60/advice_on_how_to_change_my_mindset_about/,selfimprovement,1.0,Question,0.9904,0.10440476190476192,0.0,1,0.3180009523809524,1

1plognl,we are the stories we tell ourselves,"a lot of nofap gets blown out of proportion I think but one thing I can unequivocally say as truth is we are the stories we tell ourselves. 

Some people can pmo to the sickest most deranged filth they can find and if they themselves are okay with that... I think they can still have confidence, a healthy fulfilling life etc but for someone else who is maybe a bit harsher on themselves(me) or just views this whole thing as a weakness it can become crippling to their self image. 

No one knows how much you touch yourself or to what except YOU. You are the one that makes this a problem. If it is a problem to you then you have to accept that and try your best to stay true to yourself... because I repeat, we are the stories we tell ourselves.

what kind of person do you want to be? When I ask myself that truthfully I don't want to be this person who pleasures thy self to some random thot on a monitor, to me that is hollow. I stride to eat healthy mostly and to be semi athletic, I want to have a body, spirit and mind that can attract someone who I truly want to explore. Plus I just feel better when I take care of myself. That is my truth and when I pmo regularly the other things become less consistent, i work out less.. I'll eat more garbage than I normally do, etc  . I imagine the person I'd be if the story I can tell myself everyday is one of improvement. One of delayed gratification instead of instant cheap dopamine release, building towards my goals, desires.. shaping my life with agency instead of kinda drifting from year to year steadily declining as we all do with age. I'm 30 soon to be 31, eventually it will be too late to actualize the life I want if I keep being so lackadaisical and indulgent to my monkey desires. Eventually whatever spark I have keeping my spirit alive will extinguish, I know what I want. 

I know the story I want to tell myself.

1plwp4k,I Thought Something Was Wrong With Me.,"I have spent years on self-improvement, trying to maximize my day. I woke up early in the day. I tracked my habits. I read all the books. I did the work.

But I still hit a wall.

I'd be doing my daily deep work, and I'd just find myself reaching out for my phone at the first mental road block … I'd jump to Twitter, convinced I was stressed, or maybe needed a break.  
It wasn't stress or my diet cause i had them both fully optimized.

Turns out there is this thing called **Working Memory** which is the capacity of my brain to hold and focus on thought. For me, this was capped. The brain fog despite consistent good habits, the lack of focus despite doing my best on dopamine detox.

Think of it this way: You can go to the gym every day, but if you only do bicep curls, you'll never deadlift 400 lbs. Your strength is limited by the weakest muscle group.

My ""bicep curl"" was reading articles about dopamine. My **weak muscle group** was the mental energy required to sustain complex thought, connect learned ideas, and consistently exercise self-control.  
  
How did I get here? I found this test that quantified my mental capacity. Using it led me to realize how much I needed to train this skill. My Working Memory wasn't as good as I had thought. And to think I was relying on it for every complex thought, connection, and moment of self-control my entire life.

It felt like a gut-punch. My score was embarrassingly low. It was the first time I realized how much I was **leaving on the table** simply because of how my brain wired and that I had remained untrained, never doing anything about it.

I ended up training it for a while and now, I am so much more productive, and I am even less likely to get sucked in my usual bad habits. At the end of the day I still have so much energy to learn and do more. And I feel like I can grasp more complex topics more easily now.  
My brain is completely different, now I wonder how I ever managed to do things before, because of the clear gap between current me and the past me.

I thought I would leave this here so that anyone else out there has a chance to remove this heavy load they don't even know they have.

1plrons,Should I quit my job to focus on my goals?,"So lately I have been working towards getting into a much better career in the lineman field working on powerlines. I’ve done good on my fitness and have put work inwards but the last month or two I’ve found that my motivation and such has greatly decreased and I’ve sort of put my goals on the sideline.

I feel so alone and unwanted that I don’t even want to live for myself. I feel like it’s too late to even find friends but I want to improve. I want to be happy but I don’t know where to start.

1pluyso,How to not care while remaining productive?,"Not to sound egotistic (I genuinely don't think highly of myself the vast majority of the time), but I am insane when I have the right mix of ""Who cares?"" with discipline.

I am not particularly and attractive and am extremely socially awkward. But, the very few times I've been in the headspace of ""fuck it"" I approach women, don't care if they reject me, and am quite the flirt when I don't care. At work, I can manage dozens of possible events, motivations, intonations, and ramifications and how they will effect strategies I propose before any other colleagues. When I don't care about who I'm presenting to or what their title is, it can be a stunningly effective combination. I design luxury cars for a hobby and they are typically abysmal. However, when I don't care about how my ideas will be perceived or whether I'm following norms, I can truly make something beautiful.

How do I pick and choose what I don't care about and discipline myself to pursue what I want while ignoring what I don't? To be disciplined is to care about what you do. They inherently juxtapose each other. Yet I've been able to do it before.

I haven't cared about much the last couple of days, which has lead to blips of perfect combinations, bur generally has lead to me not caring about my job, bills, mental state, health and has lead to me being buzzed nearly every day. How do I not care while disciplining myself enough to not lose grip on reality?

I can simply pick and chose what I do and don't care about, but it won't give me the ""reckless spirit"" I have when nothing truly matters. If I try to gaslight myself into thinking nothing matters when it's most useful, I typically pick up on the trick and the whole thing falls apart.",1,5,2025-12-14 01:49:46,anonymous_muffin_,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pluyso/how_to_not_care_while_remaining_productive/,selfimprovement,1.0,Question,-0.9661,0.10706605222734256,-0.5702399015426636,-1,-0.5535367403258633,-1
1pleztf,Why Carrying Someone Else's Unawareness Debt Will Bankrupt You,"
In my little self-help journey, I’ve realized the more self-correction I commit to, the more I’m just at the tip of the iceberg. What I know for sure is that I know nothing. I’m constantly piecing together the structural patterns that have kept me in a cycle of self-destruction and chaos. You know how people who are finally diagnosed with a mental condition report that their initial reaction was relief? I recognize that feeling; when you are AWARE of your self-sabotaging antics, you can spot them and intercept them.

Self-Awareness is the skill you develop when you can finally look at yourself from the perspective of other people, allowing you to self-reflect and self-improve. The fascinating thing is that some people go through life having never developed this skill, and it’s not only heartbreaking to see, it’s exhausting to be the supporting cast in their drama.
Today, we’re looking at the consequences of this dynamic through the lens of the Emotional Balance Sheet.

___The Lie They Live:___
*The Architecture of the Split Self*

What do I mean when I say someone lacks self-awareness? It means there is a gaping chasm between who the individual believes they are and how they are perceived by the people around them. Lacking self-awareness is the absence of a reliable internal mirror. They are chronically blind to how their actions impact the world and themselves.
This blindness is a consequence of the Split Self—a necessary division between:
The Idealized Self: What the individual needs to believe about themselves —""I'm a good person with good intentions, and I am always the victim.""
The Actualized Reality: Their lived truth—the failures and flaws they’re too ashamed to admit, the behaviors that hurt others, and the emotional burden they place on everyone around them instead of addressing it themselves.

This structural splitting is a coping mechanism. It protects their fragile ego from objective reality and the harsh demands of accountability. They would always prefer someone else deals with their bullcrap than face it themselves.

___The Liability Transfer Mechanism___
*(AKA: The Soyboy Crybaby Routine)*

So how does their bullcrap become yours to deal with? Honestly, the mental gymnastics happen with such quick precision it flies right over your head; it’s genuinely impressive.

I had a friend, Paul, who demonstrated this perfectly. Paul would do something insulting, and when I addressed it, he would deny it happened. Now I was tasked with proving that he did it. After acknowledging the event, I then had to convince him that it genuinely upset me—which is wild because I know what I felt. To do that, I often had to draw from previous examples, showing him it was just another repeat of the same exhausting thing.

Paul concedes to my point, but not before demanding to be let off the hook because ""I'm a good person, you know that though!"" instead of simply apologizing for the simple misunderstanding. If he squeezes out a mandated apology, he immediately pivots: now he’s the one who is devastated that he said something insulting and I actually felt insulted by it.

He also feels profoundly betrayed that I would compare his current mistake to an older, eerily similar one, accusing me of ""keeping score.""
I point out that I'm not keeping score; I’m showing him a pattern of behavior. If he had just apologized, I would not have had to make those comparisons in the first place. His response? ""Patterns? What do you mean Patterns??""

He pivots again, retreating to his cozy corner of ""Okay... It's okay.... Everyone thinks I'm the bad guy, but all I ever do is..... (queue the credits)."" All because I dared to be hurt by an insulting thing he said. It’s a mastery level of denial, aversion, gaslighting, guilt-tripping, and suddenly settling on victimhood.

You're experiencing what happens when someone decides to trade reality for peace of mind—theirs, not yours. The issue is no longer the broken glass they caused; the issue is you insisting there’s glass when they clearly see nothing. They don't just avoid the subject; they make the subject you.
​The sheer psychic weight of proving your reality to them—the hours you spend repeating yourself, the exhaustion of the emotional labor—is the emotional debt they successfully transfer onto your shoulders. They skate free while you’re stuck doing the heavy lifting of their unexamined life

___Protecting the Self:___
*The Structural Retreat*

Paul and I did this endlessly, and I was growing tired of the cycle. I learned that confronting him, we never reached a conclusion, and I only expended resources. I finally asked him what he noticed when I got confronted versus when he was confronted.
""When I tell you what the problem is, we talk about it and we reach a conclusion seamless,"" he said. What’s different when I confront him? ""We talk but we never seem to reach a conclusion somehow.""
I introduced the Broken Glass Analogy: ""If you tell me there's a broken glass on the ground and I need to sweep it up, I get the broom and sweep it up. When I tell you there's a broken glass on the ground and you need to sweep it up, you deny there’s any glass on the floor. It doesn't matter how much we talk about the glass; if you don't see it, it doesn't get cleaned up.""
For a moment, I saw him understand the agony of his idealized self being disconnected from reality. But the following day, the Split Self returned. ""Let's face it, I'm just a soft and easy punching bag for everyone and that's how you see me too.""
In that moment, I didn't see my friend of a decade anymore. I saw the agonizing 24-year-old woman I once was in my own cycle of self-unawareness, and I cannot think of a more painful existence. I wasn't always 'that bitch.' I had to put in years of deliberate, cognitive labor to achieve even baseline awareness. The work involved:
 * Regulating my own anger and controlling my rageful retorts.
 * Teaching myself to remove profanity and low-hanging insults from arguments.
 * Refusing to engage in discussions while still angry because I knew I couldn't trust what flies out my mouth.
 * Learning to spot my pivot toward victim/villain irrational patterns.
 * Developing the ability to say to myself: ""That's not what happened, you're actually the problem this time.""

And I couldn't even get him to acknowledge my point, whether or not he agrees. No one can make you see that until you are ready to cut the crap and get real with yourself. Paul is just not there, and I am not capable of carrying his debt anymore. It’s his job to do the emotional work that holds him accountable and liberates him—not mine. My job is to protect the ""self"" I fought to become.
All the while, he’s ruminating about how I'm just like everyone else who used and discarded his big, big heart. Woe is him and his soyboy persona he prioritizes over facing uncomfortable truths. He won't acknowledge the broken glass. I have to withdraw the emotional and psychological resources I'm spending on this catastrophic meltdown that's, ironically, not catastrophic at all, It's all self-deception. I have to let the protagonist of this narrative own his script when he finally chooses to.

___Conclusion:___
*Zeroing Out the Balance Sheet*

The biggest lesson in structural self-awareness is recognizing when you are being used as a bank for someone else's emotional debt. The cost of their self-unawareness should never appear on your balance sheet. The moment you recognize the Hidden Liability, your only successful move is the Structural Retreat. You are not abandoning them; you are simply refusing to co-sign the debt that is destined to bankrupt you.",12,9,2025-12-13 12:17:41,Strange_Island_5243,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pleztf/why_carrying_someone_elses_unawareness_debt_will/,selfimprovement,1.0,Other,-0.9982,0.0224961974961975,-0.735024631023407,0,-0.662473076012464,-1
1pl2v7y,Getting past being poorly educated,"How do you get past being poorly educated? I know the simple answer is to learn, but how to come to know ""unknown unknowns""?

My upbringing was upper middle class, but my dad's factory manager job took us to a really poor rural area. Like 2/3 of the population was illiterate, dropout rate was 60%, teachers made below minimum wage. Other country's Peace Corps sent teachers to us.

I was never very good at math and science, so I got put in the remedial classes where I got Cs. We were told what to put on the state test, and specifically told not to think into the problems at all. Same with college, went to an open enrollment ""daycare center"" and was able to graduate with just remedial math. Combined with a learning disability I finished both with a piece of paper and zero knowledge.

20 years later, I live in a major metro area and it's patently obvious how poorly educated I am. I can't keep up with conversations. I struggle in my hospital IT job because I couldn't tell you what a cell does, let alone what a cell testing machine in the lab does. People tell me ""you don't need science for this, it's just an enzyme blah blah"". I come off intelligently by the way I speak at first, but after a while it's obvious how little I know.

I did Khan academy and got lost by about their ""7th grade"". I tried biology, and their lessons don't go basic enough.

1plfnm3,Being a zero is a superpower,"All of my life, I was a zero. Okay, I am exaggerating, don't get me wrong. I am grateful and have accomplished a fair bit, but there was always this mediocrity that stuck with me.

I still feel like I am mediocre. Whatever pursuit I take up, I will give the first few days my best, then eventually lose interest and give up, to find the next one and the vicious cycle continues.

However, heres what this taught me. When you are at ""zero"" and have nothing to lose you have that much more freedom than the next person who has already chosen and has a burden of responsibility.

The advantage here is that while that person has to first decide if his existing situation is ideal for him, that is emotionally expensive, while you only have to overcome your zero state by building up an initial velocity towards the goal you choose. This is a serious superpower.

People like familiarity and pattern, it is very difficult to get off a toxic or a comfortable situation.

1pkte7x,You are who you surround yourself with,"i have been the “therapist friend” since i first had a friend. i don’t know if it was because i was just naturally very empathetic and had an urge to help people or if i was forced into the role somewhat. each best friend i’ve had has been very mentally unwell, not their fault and that’s not what im saying throughout this. it’s just the fact. i always seemed to draw people who were struggling very hard, didnt want therapy but wanted help, always was the centre of the conversation. at first it bothered me, but then that conditioned me to not expect to be vulnerable. i learned how to not need people’s help (which is not a good thing).

over the past two years, i had 2 friends. we were in a trouple type friendship. they both had severe OCD and depression so they got closer then me, which is fine. when they’d talk about that stuff, i would comfort them and they always congratulated me on that, even if it meant waking up at 5 a.m to a facetime call. i didn’t mind genuinely, but it caused bad effects to me. the first girl was severely unstable, like the worst i’ve ever met. i’m not judging in a bad way, again just setting context. we stopped being friends because i genuinely couldn’t take it anymore. i felt my mind morphing into hers, all of a sudden i was getting these intrusive thoughts. i cried to my sister one night about it because i was scared she triggered something in me. my sister said “just because SHE thinks like that, doesn’t mean you have to”. which really stuck with me.

she was insanely toxic in other ways. she depended too much on people and i never hated her for it, but i had to sacrifice our friendship for my own mental wellbeing. the second friend was a bit of a trickier situation. she was also unstable, hadn’t left the house in a year but our friendship was not as toxic. we actually didn’t really talk about the shit going on in our life. i felt unfulfilled because of the fact she wouldn’t talk to me about her problems but i realised that was a me problem. i always expected to give advice in friendships and i didn’t have to in this. but even so, we spent everyday all day on facetime together. i saw myself becoming like her. not leaving the house, picking up OCD-like behaviours because i’d see her doing them all the time. we didn’t stop being friends we still are, we just don’t facetime anymore and barely talk.

TL;DR:

the people you spend the most time with can directly shape your mental health. when you’re constantly around friends who are unstable, dependent, or struggling intensely, you can absorb their stress, their habits, and even their thought patterns. over time, you can find yourself mirroring their behaviors, taking on their emotional burdens, and losing track of your own needs. who you surround yourself with doesn’t just influence you, it can genuinely alter your mental state. which i found insane. now i find myself with a mental state that’s also unstable, i hope i can find myself again. i just feel like im collateral of everyone’s suffering. and because i left myself be that figure.

Though, admittedly, I was never as smart as I thought I was. But lately I’m realising how much of a rut I’ve been in these past few years. Been grappling with brain fog, a completely shot attention span, and poor memory but I’m only just now understanding how bad it’s gotten. Really it’s just been steadily declining since finishing grad school.

Work isn’t very mentally stimulating, to say the least, but that’s not the extent of the issue. I realized a few months ago that I hadn’t actually finished a full book all year, for example, when I used to be a very avid reader. Sure I started plenty but I always got distracted. So I’ve started fixing that one, and have had some success! Also been trying to limit my social media use a lot more. I’ve deleted a lot of my accounts and basically only check Facebook for people’s life updates (and honestly that may be on the chopping block soon), Discord to hang with my buds who all live in different places, and Reddit for fun (but that’s due for a reduction). But I need to go further in my efforts to improve.

I was wondering if anyone here had any advice to offer on improving yourself cognitively & intellectually and staying motivated while doing so? I’m approaching the halfway point of my life and I definitely don’t want to spend the rest of it with my brain gradually atrophying from lack of use.

Small things annoy me and I show that I’m annoyed. 

I have a very kind and supportive partner, and he’s a big reason I want to do better. Sometimes after an interaction I imagine someone looking at it from aside and I always feel like I would look like a right a**hole in that situation. That thought really bothers me. 

I know being aware is a good thing, but I’ve been aware of this for years. I have become a little calmer over time, but I still have a way to go. I used to be described as impulsive and very negative, especially when I had a bit of a rough patch for a few years, and I feel like that improved a lot, but sometimes I struggle to shake the negativity that inevitably creeps back in. 

I usually apologise and acknowledge I’ve gone too far, but I often feel like I’ve already ruined the mood. Why can’t I just chill out? Also shocker, but I’m fairly sure I inherited this from my parent.

Forgot to add, if someone gets under my skin (like being very mean to me or someone I care about) or something unfortunate happens I really struggle letting it go. I’m sure it’s somehow related. 


TL;DR I react in ways that are overly negative and escalate with no need. I want to do better and I’ve been working on it but it feel like I just can’t seem to lose the attitude ",6,10,2025-12-13 06:30:33,Own-Bird-8796,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pl8hfb/will_i_ever_lose_the_shitty_attitude/,selfimprovement,1.0,Question,0.9213,0.09474888392857143,-0.6528932452201843,1,-0.031106845824377893,0

1pkyy4p,Why do I keep hearing that I am not “enough”?,"A little deep of a question today but I just would like to have some conversation instead of using ChatGPT as my stand-in therapist on this issue.

Every time I meet someone I really like and things seem to be going really well, they back away from me and eventually tell me that it wasn’t “enough” for them. One after spending the most beautiful three weeks of my life in years, another after he flew out from another country to see me, and one after I finally took it serious and stated my intentions and communicated from the beginning and he still claimed he liked me and really enjoyed spending time with me.

They all said it wasn’t “enough” for them. And it’s completely shocking to me every time. I’m trying to not take all of the blame myself but it seems like some weird theme is happening here. I lay awake almost every night hearing their haunting words “it wasn’t enough” over and over. And it’s driving me crazy. I don’t know why spending time with a girl they claim to be very physically attracted to and really enjoy spending time with and admire as a person, is not enough.

I know this type of thing could have a million possibilities and answers, but it seems like something way deeper is happening than just surface level explanations. I’ve done a lot of reflecting on my actions, obsessively, and while I am definitely not perfect I truly don’t think there is anything I do that is so wrong that would push away someone especially during the beginning stage of a new connection where everything is fun and fresh and sexy and your brain is constantly being pumped full of dopamine.",11,18,2025-12-12 23:44:01,Flaky-Boysenberry466,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pkyy4p/why_do_i_keep_hearing_that_i_am_not_enough/,selfimprovement,0.79,Question,0.9872,0.04191483803552769,-0.501160204410553,0,0.05396286540182904,0

1pkxbdb,Hitting rock bottom,"Hi there! 23F here. Feeling like i have hit the rock bottom and there's no way out.

I did a BBA away from home. Graduated and moved back home at 21. At that point i was engaged. It was a long distance relationship. After coming back home i decided to pursue a professional accountancy course. 
But that is when things went downhill. Life just hit a pause. Being back home was like a nightmare. My mum seemed like a completely different person, i had no friends in the city, the accountancy course i pursued was too difficult. I, instead of wanting to make a path for myself just went into a waiting mode for things to change.

My relationship ended pretty abruptly last year. In a lot of ways, i am really glad it ended. I have been trying to figure things out but it's like i am stuck in quick sand.

I am still not able to clear the accountancy exams. I have gained a lot of weight. No friends still. I don't leave my house for days. Most days my biggest worries are, when to shower and when to sleep. Any other thoughts are tucked away with doomscrolling (not something i enjoy. But still very much addicted) I have also been doing therapy for over 3 years but nothing seems to be improving. 

This is not how i want to live my 20s. There is so much i want to do but i just am not able to. I feel stuck and paralyzed. I feel anxious. I feel ugly, week and useless. And it's not just how i feel but also my reality. I don't know how to change it, not when i feel so week.

I watch other men be chosen over me in social and work settings, move quickly into relationships, and get pulled into networks where they’re invited places and set up with friends. Desirable men don’t stay single long.

That has never happened to me. No one offers to set me up. When I’ve asked female relatives to help, they agree and then never follow up. In mixed social settings I often feel invisible, and being out with my conventionally attractive brother makes the contrast in how women respond to us hard to ignore.

1pkxv29,Fixing my finances has weirdly become the biggest part of my self-improvement journey,"I always thought self-improvement meant waking up at 5am, journaling, meditating, reading a book a week… all that aesthetic stuff you see online. And yeah, some of those habits are great, but what I didn’t expect was that the thing forcing me to actually grow was something way less glamorous: fixing my finances.

It started a few months ago when I realized how stressed I felt every time I checked my bank balance. I’d been avoiding it for years. I wasn’t spending recklessly, but I also wasn’t paying attention. No plan, no structure, just hoping nothing crazy happened. I kept telling myself I was “figuring it out,” but honestly I was just procrastinating adulthood.

Once I started budgeting, tracking my bills, and cleaning up my credit, I noticed something weird. My discipline slowly improved in other areas too. Like, once you hold yourself accountable for something as uncomfortable as money, holding yourself accountable for other habits doesn’t feel as scary. You can’t lie to yourself when numbers are staring you in the face.

And rebuilding my credit has become its own lesson. I started using a Fizz debit card that reports to the bureaus, so I can build credit without touching debt, and it forced me to actually look at my spending every day. It made me realize how many decisions I used to make on autopilot. Now even small wins, like paying a bill early or sticking to a weekly budget, make me feel more in control.

It sounds silly, but managing money has taught me more patience and discipline than any “become your best self” video ever did. I didn’t magically become a different person, but I feel more grounded. More capable. Like I’m actually steering my life instead of just reacting to it.

It makes you regret being honest.

So I pulled back. Not out of bitterness, just out of self preservation.

one thing that somewhat helped was doing something small for myself: venting in a notes . No expectations. No reactions. No pressure to make my feelings sound “reasonable.”

I just write whatever I’m feeling in that moment.

And weirdly, it feels like self care.

Not because the app (august ai) fixes anything, but because it lets me be honest without guilt.

So I default to surface level small talk and wonder why I never connect with anyone deeply.

My therapist pointed out I need to practice being vulnerable before I can do it in real high stakes situations, but like where do you practice that?? I can't just go up to my friends or colleagues and practice revealing personal stuff, that's weird and puts pressure on them also mine

I started using some low pressure methods to build confidence first. Writing in journals helps but doesn't capture the back and forth of actual conversation, talking to an AI companion about genuine feelings without fear of judgment has been surprisingly helpful for getting comfortable with vulnerability itself

It sounds weird but practicing saying things out loud about how I actually feel, testing different ways to express myself, doing it in a space where there's zero stakes, it's building confidence to eventually do it with real people. Baby steps toward being more authentic in actual relationships.

Each minor task takes so much mental effort and time, and I feel like I'm doing mental gymnastics. I am currently unemployed, 27, and trying to finish up a course for a certificate, and I've only looked at one slide in 9 days. I have only been doing things that require more physical effort (cleaning the house, helping my family with things), but when it comes to things that require high executive function, even the slightest mental effort, or strategic thinking, I just stay stagnant. I feel like I've gotten in my own way so much that I couldn't succeed at anything. I want to finish tasks, I want to complete projects, and be reliable. I always feel like a liability wherever I work, or in my personal life, I can't keep my end of the bargain when trying to commit to something.

It is becoming very hard to live with, and as much as I want to improve my life, I don't know where to start. I am so afraid of wasting my potential. There are friends, cousins, people who I am slowly seeing surpass me in life, some even living my dream, and it's crushing to see. For other folks, that may be all it takes to get up and push through, but when I try, I am met with the mental gymnastics, and a whole day goes by, then a week, then a month, where I get nothing done for my own improvement. It is painful.

What can I do? Even when I try to build a system, it is so hard to stick with.

1pkn7q9,How do you deal with the desperation to achieve something when nothing works out?,"I don’t know if it’s just me, but lately I feel desperate to achieve something in life. I’m working hard, trying my best, pushing myself… yet every time it ends in zero results. It’s like I’m stuck in this never ending cycle. Effort → hope → disappointment → repeat.

People keep telling me “manifest good things,” “think positive,” “trust the universe,” but honestly… how does that even work? I’m tired of acting like things will magically fall into place just because I wished for it.
I’m showing up, I’m trying, I’m giving whatever I can with the little energy I have left.

And it’s not like I’m lazy or sitting around waiting for shortcuts. I am working. I’m trying to improve, trying to show up every day, but somehow the results never match the effort. It’s draining. It makes me question if I’m doing something wrong, or if I’m just not meant to get the things I want.

The worst part is seeing others get what you’re fighting so hard for with less than half the effort. Not jealous, but it hurts.
Feels like life is moving for everyone… except me.

I don’t want to lose hope, but I’m tired. Tired of pushing, tired of pretending, tired of expecting something good and ending up with nothing.

And tbh I have said curse words to him before when joking with him. So now he always says “ fck you “ to me and “ shut up “ whenever I try to talk to him. 
He’s also very defensive and when I try to joke or just talk with him he starts screaming and cursing at me. Like I take 1 chip from him and he starts screaming loud and fussing. 

But it’s my fault tbh because before in the past whenever he tried to take some food from me I would get mad so I guess he just copies that behavior.  And tbh I always bother him a lot and he just doesn’t like it and sees me as annoying. When he swears at me I can’t try to press him about it because he obviously won’t listen. 
And I can’t try to do it physically because that probably will make him become violent. But he always talks to me all aggressive like I’m his enemy or something.

I’m also scared when I walk past someone and they’re staring at me I get intimidated.

1pj8bvt,"I quit caffeine, p*rn, doomscrolling, junk food and vaping all at once about three months ago.","Today is my 96 day I quit all of this stuff. It sounds extreme, but it didn’t feel like some insane discipline chalenge. For me quitting everything at once was about as hard as quitting one thing, just without letting my brain jump to a new distraction.

What changed?

The biggest change was how quiet my head got. I can sit with myself without instantly reaching for stimulation, and I’m a lot more present with people. Work feels smoother too: I just sit, focus, finish, and move on instead of fighting urges every ten minutes haha.

My confidence didnt suddenly explode like people say, it just built slowly. Trusting myself a tiny bit more each week made a big difference. Now meeting new people feels easier and got a girlfriend through the process (If you are reading this, I love you ❤️).

And, for my surprise, the things I quit feel boring now. It could sound weird but it isnt because I’m above them, my brain isn’t starved for constant hits anymore.

How I changed it?

The mindset that helped the most was keeping it to “just today.” Forever, decades, years, months (even weeks) is too big. Today is the best because it is just some small steps and, if you know the compound effect, well, there you go.

I also stopped beating myself up every time I felt cravings or slipped. I am chrsitian, so I used to fight this a lot back then. But I needed to remember that we're forgiven just to be a child of God. If you're non-religious: slipping isn’t a failure, it’s part of being human. You don’t need to ""earn"" the right to start over. You can just start again.

Idk If can mention the apps but near the end of this whole process, I also started using tools to stay focused and consistent about what I actually wanted to work towards (Purposa - chase your dreams) and to keep my phone from dragging me back (Opal). It was like a month ago that I started using these and it was when I mostly needed them.

Before all of this I’d spent years trying to quit each habit separately: games since I was a child, caffeine for years and scrolling basically my whole adult life Basically, nothing stuck because every time I dropped one thing, I’d pick up another.

Advice

I’m not saying everyone should do this, but if you feel stuck in those adicctions, it’s not hopeless. Lower the noise a bit, take it one day at a time, and keep things simple. The real work was just showing up every day and not running away from myself.

I got off of work, made a great dinner, and then suddenly the evening melted away into screen time. 

I started to feel down, as I had ""wasted"" a few hours and it was basically then 11:30. I've been trying to pause when I feel that way and say ""hey, just 10 minutes to feel better."" 

Then it's off the bed or couch, and do the self care routine. 5 minutes to do a quick face wash, brush teeth, brush and braid hair, and then 5 minutes of stretching (or however long I feel like). 

Then to bed ""properly."" It really is a mood booster. It's been tough to feel motivated with the time change, even for the small things, but we got this. Just 5 or 10 minutes to shift the energy around is all it takes sometimes.

1pk8bt5,Book recommendations as a gift please!!?,"Hello everyone- I'm aspiring to buy a few inspirational motivational books as gifts for my brother who listens to Joe Rogan (please don't judge, it's his interests) and has taken interest in many of his Motivational guests.

Can anyone recommend some excellent reads from someone along those paths? My brother is 40, a father of three small children, and reaching a point in his life where he's trying to be the best he can. Not necessarily looking for fitness primary, more so life mind and wellness. Perhaps even life navigation as a father.

1pk2vqd,How can you becoming a less anxious person?,"I’m curious about your opinions. I recently took a language exam, and while I was watching the people around me, I realized how much someone’s general well-being (and basically everything) is influenced by how nervous, overthinking, anxious, or, on the other hand, how calm they are. Unfortunately, I belong to the first group, but I’ve always been really interested in how I could improve myself, especially in this area.

The usual calming thoughts don’t really work for me, even though I know there’s nothing at stake, nothing changes whether I pass or fail, and that the examiners are just people too, they (hopefully) won’t intentionally hurt me, etc. I’ve read so many of these typical “don’t worry” ideas that I don’t think you could tell me anything new, but sadly, none of it has really helped me move forward. I still shake, I can barely speak, and it makes both the exam and the night before extremely difficult. Even while I’m talking, I don’t calm down; I often freeze up and can’t think, and my heart rate goes through the roof, which makes me even more afraid. The only somewhat comforting thought is that my problems don’t start there, but still, when I’m actually in the situation, I can’t detach myself from it.

I really envy those people who take exams completely calm, with minimal anxiety, as if they were just chatting with a friend. My biggest wish is to improve at least a little, but sometimes I feel like it might be physically impossible. Are people simply “born this way,” making the whole thing hopeless?

1pk5nlx,Procrastination Tips,"**This is a repost of a comment I made because I think it's helpful for everyone**  
**This is advice to help those who struggle to get enough dopamine\*, but should be helpful for everyone!**

You're brain isn't producing enough dopamine. It is unlikely that this is something that you can ""fix"" at this point in your life, as it is a brain structure issue that forms during critical and sensitive periods of early childhood and infancy. Your brain, not being able to find the dopamine it needs, is looking for anything that is stimulating enough.

To help with answering your question about how to improve, there's an article by David D. Nowell that I will summarize into 7 points to help you out :)

1. **Choices** \- Reduce the number of choices you have to make. Choices cost fuel, and your body is naturally low on fuel. Make the rules be super simple non-negotiable rules. Also part of this is turning off as many distractions as possible. Everyone gets distracted by their phones. You are not everyone. You're *worse*. Turn the notifications off (at least for a set time).
2. **Sleep** \- People need at least 7 hours of sleep. Sleep is the most effective way for your brain to make the correct signals and restock on fuel. When you run low on sleep, you run low everywhere. Also, don't be fooled by your apparent wakefulness—people who slept for 6 hours did just as poorly as those that slept 4 hours in performance tests, but those who had 4 hours of sleep were able to recognise that they weren't doing well. TL;DR Sleep for 7+ hours *as much as possible*. (Given your situation, I recognise that's a lot of work and sleepless nights. Try your best.)
3. **Protein** \- Protein is really great because it takes a long time to break down into energy, so it delivers to your brain in a steady stream of fuel. Sugar is not like that; it breaks down easy and spikes your sugar levels, throwing your brain for a loop thinking it has enough energy to get things going only for it to have the power cut and it freaks out. Some things that have decent protein: Nuts, Rolled Oats, Cheeses, Yogurt, Eggs, Lean Meats, Whole Milk.
4. **Exercise** \- Before you shrug this off as not very helpful, I am NOT saying to exercise regularly or for the health of your body (though those are good things, too). I'm *saying*, if you do like, 10 minutes of high-intensity workout *just before* you have to do mentally exhausting work, it tends to help. Try doing Pomodoro methods but exercising during the break. (If you don't know, Pomodoro is when you do work for like, 20-30 minutes and then take a scheduled 5-10 minute break. Try incorporating exercise into those breaks!)
5. **Calendar** \- Don't try to put everything into calendars. Put it all in **one** calendar. Don't worry about putting everything in there either, but make it a practice to have your time broken up beforehand and to put important tasks and events (e.g. doctor's appointments, birthday parties, job meetings, etc.) in your calendar. This goes back to minimizing decisions. This one is probably going to be tricky, though, in med school. Again, try your best.
6. **Team** \- Get people to help you. Tell people that you need reminders to eat health (and high-protein ;)) foods. Or if you have something coming up, ask them to make sure you put it in your calendar (and *actually* make sure you put it in your calendar...). It's so much easier if the people around you know what you need, and it keeps you accountable.
7. HËDŸDT - (Umlauts—the dots—for silliness) Stands for How-Exactly-Did-You-Do-That. I pronounce it head-yet. It focuses on finding what does work. When you find yourself pushing through the really boring tasks, try to think about what happened that got you to actually get there. It not only helps you recreate that, but it also boosts your morale because you're recognising that silly little brain guy did it! Yayyy! It's important to be specific in this one, and there's an analogy I will use to explain this, but it's not mine. Imagine: Your grandmother reliably makes a fantastic pound cake, and you want to reproduce that pound cake. *How exactly does she do that?* If you ask her what's in her delicious cake, she'll give you a vague response about flour, butter, and sugar. But her *specific* behavior sequence needs to be pulled apart and fully understood and repeated *exactly* if you want to accurately replicate her cake. Does she substitute the butter with margarine? It changes the cake. Does she use lemon *extract* instead of lemon *zest*? It makes a different cake. Does she bake it in a gas oven and not an electric oven? Changes the cake. Point being, when you are figuring out HËDŸDT, you got to be precise.

Anyway, that was a long spiel. I hope that helps! I like this list because it's practical advice and not advice that a distracted person would get... *too*... distracted trying to do :)



TL;DR:   
 \- Minimize Choices  
 \- Sleep at least 7 hours a night  
 \- Eat foods with high protein and low sugar  
 \- Do short bursts of high-intensity workouts before intense focus sessions  
 \- Use a calendar to help you organize thoughts (diminishing choices) and to help you not forget things  
 \- Get help from other people who can support you within your systems  
 \- Figure out the individual things that work for you and *take note*



**\*There is a phrase going around, ""dopamine detox,"" that does not refer to this. That phrase is the idea that too much of your dopamine is being found in unhealthy ways, and you ""detox"" your sources.** ***You need dopamine to function*****. Oftentimes, people turn to these unhealthy sources of dopamine because they are deficient in natural sources of dopamine. This list is to help with that natural deficiency.**",2,5,2025-12-12 00:24:31,bembear1,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1pk5nlx/procrastination_tips/,selfimprovement,0.75,Tips and Tricks,0.9986,0.08479531035665296,0.0,1,0.3165390620713306,1
1pjpw84,My life has genuinely sucked for the last 7 years,"I am 21 never had real friends in my life, never had “fun” in my life, always was bullied or isolated a lot by others when I was young, always super stressed in school over grades, studying all the time when I was in school because I was constantly hounded by a tiger mom, now I’m in college with poor grades, no career prospects and still no friends. I had deep insecurities in the past, went through years of depression/anxiety and… now I’m still losing badly in life. I have never felt real lasting happiness or connection with anyone for so many years.

I’m deeply unsatisfied and disappointed with life. All these years have been immersed in emptiness and desolation, when it should have been immersed in youthful zeal and lifelong memories. 

And now despite working so hard, grinding through everything and self improving for the last how many years I still am not enjoying my life at all because I have failed and failed again. I have gone through so much self improvement, read self help book, changed my mindset and done inner work, but still my life sucks.

I’m 21, I'm supposed to be enjoying these years of my life, working hard and making good memories. yet I’m here, despite putting in the work I only suffer.

1pk7ftu,Follow-Up: What I Actually Do When I’m Spiralling at 3AM (Chronic Anxiety PTSD Edition),"So I made a post about being pushed to my limits, and as someone with chronic anxiety and PTSD, how I still pushed through. I honestly thought people would call me cringe, but instead I got so much love. That’s why I genuinely like this community. Some even DMed their stories, and that meant a lot.

But one person said something real. They said when it’s 3 a.m., they’re spiralling alone, when you're straight up about to end your shit, how you gonna get through that? And that hit. Reading advice is easy, but living through panic at night feels like drowning.

So here’s what I actually do. The real stuff. Shaky knees, hot and cold flashes, sweating, dizziness, chest cramps, stomach going mad, all of it. In those moments, “just live in the moment” doesn’t do anything.

What actually helped me is learning that the brain can unlearn panic. Neuroplasticity. Your default hypervigilant mode isn’t permanent, but it takes time and tiny habits every single day.

Long-term stuff like yoga, meditation, hobbies, diet, they help, but not always at 3 a.m. So here’s my immediate routine.

I set reminders on my phone every few hours. Stuff like “hey, you’re safe,” “you’re not gonna die,” “snap out of it.” When I’m spiralling, one of these reminders usually pops up and grounds me a bit.

I also keep telling myself I’m not dying. Most fears are the brain confusing something small with a survival threat. If I’m alive, I can figure something out. It sounds dumb, but it works when your brain is going berserk.

I talk out loud and name the problem. What is it. Why does it scare me. What’s one small step I can take. It pulls me out of the emotional storm and into the rational zone. Sometimes I put something cold on my neck just to shock the system back.

And my favourite trick is setting small time targets. If it’s 1 a.m. and I’m spiralling, I set an alarm for 4. Just make it till 4. At 4, I set one for 7. By 7, I usually fall asleep. Breaking the night into pieces makes it bearable.

We overestimate what we can do in one month, but underestimate what we can do in ten years. If you survive your day in three-hour chunks, you’ll get somewhere. Maybe slow, but still forward. That’s it for now. I’ll share more later.

1pjzzjz,Why am I so obsessive? Why do I only like women who don’t care about me?,"I go on the dating apps and I get matches but as soon as they actually want to talk to me I get afraid/disinterested and it never goes anywhere. 

But back when I was dating my ex she spent the last like 6 months of the relationship giving me absolutely 0 attention, affection, or prioritization and I would have done literally anything for that woman to love me back again. 

And now there’s a new girl in my life who, to be fair, by all objective measures is super super fantastic and I am absolutely crazy about her. We’ve hung out a bunch of times and a few times ago I told her how I felt and she basically friendzoned me. She also is pretty terrible at texting me back and we only see each other every few weeks. 

And yet despite what seems to be a seemingly decent ability to talk to people and attract attractive and interesting people I don’t care about anyone else at all. And there probably hasn’t been more than like 3 or 4 hours I’ve gone without thinking about the friend zone girl since meeting her months ago. 

What is wrong with me? Why does indifference make me go so crazy for a person? Why am I immediately turned off by people who actually want me?

How can I fix this? Also side question, am I delusional for hoping for a beautiful friends to lovers slow burn situation?? Because to be fair when we do hang out it is truly excellent and amazing and I don’t know if I’ve ever felt so naturally connected to a person in a very long time or maybe ever. But she did friend zone me. But maybe I just rushed into confessing feelings.

1pj0l7w,It Took Me 15 Years to Learn These 3 Things… You Can Read Them in 5 Minutes,"First thing I wanna say is these are just my personal opinions. And if anyone is going through something, honestly, lets talk. I recently went through one of the worst phases of my life. Broke, sick, basically homeless. And for anyone who’s suffering in any way, here’s what helped me cope:

1. Get through the night.
When I’m broke, sick, hungry, stuck somewhere unfamiliar with my heart racing and my mind going to dark places… the only real goal is to survive the night. You wont fix your whole life in that moment. Just make it to morning. A new day gives you a bit more clarity and maybe some options.

2. Detachment.
If someone is damaging your mental or physical wellbeing over a long time, they’re not worth holding onto. Not talking about small fights, I mean that repeated harmful behaviour that drains you. Family, friends, anyone. If it comes to it, be ready to cut people off. It’s hard but sometimes its the only way out.

3. Get out of your head.
For overthinkers and anxious people like me, catastrophizing never helps. Half the time you can’t even think straight. What worked for me is kinda stepping back from my own thoughts. Just letting things happen a bit. Chances are whatever is happening, you’re not actually dying in the next two hours.

There’s more I wanna share but I can already hear someone typing “aint reading allat”, so I’ll save it for another post.

These mindsets take time to build. They’re not easy.
