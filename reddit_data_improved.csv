1pqmaav,Christmas is not for me and I feel sad and alone,"Hey I hope everyone is good. I wanted to just share how I am feeling. I feel lonely. I have children who are older. Divorced. Not much other family. 

Everyone is talking about their plans it just magnifies my loneliness. It's not about having plans but about having and nurturing a happy christmas holiday.

1pqlxsh,Can someone help me?,"Im only 15yo and been struggling with all sorts of self-harm urges since i was 7.

Last night i cut from my thighs to my ankles. Most of the cuts are Styros. However there are a phew that look like muscle or smth of the sorts. I am not sure what it is because i have never gone that deep before and i do not know what to do. As well as those the Styros keep reopening everytime i move and its making me incapable of getting out of my bed. Any advice on what it is and how to attend to it is useful.

Also to clarify i have ASD&ADHD and i struggle/incapable of talking to a stranger. So i would rather not go see a doctor, as well as the fact i am a minor so its hard to do anything without a guardian's approval. Also off topic, i was a SA victim when i was younger by a family member and some classmates, and alot of my issues from that. Is there anything i can do to forget or at leats solve some of my trauma?

1pqlu9y,Does anyone know what this is called?,"I know about sonder (the feeling one has on realizing that every other individual one sees has a life as full and real as one’s own, in which they are the central character and others, including oneself, have secondary or insignificant roles.)

But I often just view people that I don’t know/interact with as npcs. But when I hear personal details, it’s like, “wow, they’re living a life just like me. They have their own problems, etc” 

It wasn’t until I was in my 20s that I fully grasped that teachers for example are just real people who live lives of their own. What changed it was dating a woman who was a teacher and realizing “oh wow, my teachers growing up actually had lives”

Could it be a part of Asperger’s? I was diagnosed as a kid but have never believed I had it. ",1,0,2025-12-19 19:31:38,imcoolerthanyou710,mentalhealth,0.8674,0.1640909090909091,0.1640909090909091,LOW,-1,0.5157454545454545,0

1pqlfw9,Devastated,"I’m heartbroken, anxious and confused. A person I thought was a friend went all out against me 2 weeks before the anniversary of my dad’s death. She told me others want me gone, called me manipulative for expressing grief and did a “I can’t diagnose you but if I could…” incredibly dismissive type comment. She made out I’m lying that I’m deeply depressed my dad died. I was honest about my feelings but that was after hearing about others. I have been isolating myself and trying hard not to burden others because I am deeply hurt by it, I’ve never made a secret of that. I’m definitely not exaggerating or lying that my dad’s death has been traumatic. Idk why she waited until 2 weeks before to spring this on me or what actually lead to it because I’ve been keeping quiet. Idk why she didn’t wait because it’s only a few weeks until it’s passed.

1pql95e,Suicidal friend,"I’ve just graduated from HS (17F) and a friend of mine (17M) had recently confided to me that he’s suicidal. Worst of all he confirmed that I was the only reason he’s living. I’ve tried my best to try and tell him to get in contact with professionals or any hotlines, but he objected. He claims to hate talking to ppl in general and going outside n stuff. Plus he’s autistic too.

I’m only writing this to ask if I should stay close to him more and support him. Or try to detach from him. Ik it’s bad to cut off suicidal people but he’s genuinely making me stressed out bc I can barely do anything to help. I also don’t want to be his ‘main reason to live’ because I think that can be unbalance and can develop into something worser. 

Also also whenever I try to give him advice his reason is always ‘I’m austisic so I hate ___’. I have not experience in neurodivergence but how much can I push without dismissing his disability? (He’s using it as a reason not to find help or eat etc.) ",5,5,2025-12-19 19:05:21,Ghosting_cabbage,mentalhealth,-0.9831,-0.03316498316498316,-0.03316498316498316,HIGH,-1,-0.5081324915824915,0

1pqkn2f,I f*cked up :(,"I literally have not been on a scale in so long. I literally left a toxic relationship (it was ongoing for 6 years on and off) and then months later - serendipitously I found such a wonderful human being to share my life with. I’ve been very happy in this healthy relationship, but I believe I have gained “healthy relationship” weight. 

That , or the simple fact that I never really drank much until this year. I don’t drink often, but more socially. With that being said, after leaving my toxic relationship I finally got to hangout with friends and I’ve drank a lot. I also, EAT my feelings and feel like a bottomless pit. Like I don’t know when to STOP. 

In the last couple of months, I’ve tried to count my calories, not drink as much, eat only portion sizes and wait 20 mins (so I can “feel actually full”), and unfortunately I’m not very active so of course it’s not doing much.

Last night I stepped on a scale. I immediately started crying. I have never been this weight before other than when I was pregnant, about 11 years ago.

1pqkldr,third person hallucinations??,"Okay so im not asking for any diagnosis or anything im just wondering if theres any name for this or if anyones had the same thing happen? It seems like something that should be common but google isnt helping much. 

A few days ago i was sitting at a bus stop just listening to music when i had the weirdest thing happen. I had the most vivid ""vision"" (idk what to call it srry) from like the third person like it was someone else seeing it of myself getting shot and dying.

 It was genuinely so realistic and freaked me out because I cant imagine images in my head at all. Ive had slight hallucinations before but they were more so auditory and not violent or anything. The only things i can find about it is things for PTSD but ive never been around any gun violence or even seen a gun in real life and i dont plan too.

I don't  think going home will help,  apart from having a GP available, I have no family there,  and no friends in either country.
